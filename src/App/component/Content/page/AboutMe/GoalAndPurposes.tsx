In germany the train is nice the poeple is nice the city is nice but I failed to see the underlying purpose of things. when my dream was satisfied (i wanted to work and live in berlin) after while I just appreciate all of them  but i cannot see purpose. The star earth go round and people mate and have kids and die and suffer and smile and quarrel.
