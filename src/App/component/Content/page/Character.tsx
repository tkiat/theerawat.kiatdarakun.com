      <TooltipText text="(Free and) Open Source Software">
        I advocate FOSS operating systems (since they are very fundamental), the availability of FOSS application software alternatives (for accessibility to the poor), and OSS for entertainment softeware like video games (for the sake of transparency). As a result, I personally use them. I like to config my operating system and write some desktop software and scripts by my own that I find it useful and share to the world. I also write some programs for the web like this website.

      <TooltipText text="Low-Impact Living">
        My ideal life based on awareness is the one free of greediness, and thus I value minimalism and sustainability (that includes veganism). It is a lot of fun and creativity boosting to find a way to make my items (like table, lamp, detergents, food, etc.) less impactful to myself, other beings, and the earth. Oftentimes I need to trade my time and convenience for it. How much should I trade? Hmm.

      <TooltipText text="Writing">
        <p>Life is too short to die alone without anything to share with others. Because the storage size of text is the lowest (as compared to another form of medium), writing seems to be the most minimalist way to convey thoughts and leave a lot of room for creativity.</p>

      <TooltipText text="Philosophy">
        Philosophy is crucial for my lifelong goal (ideal personal life and society based on awareness) since it broadens my horizon. I have yet to read a lot of works but I will deinitely do so in free time.

      &nbsp;— Because of the realization of&nbsp;
      <TooltipText text="the point of my existence">
        <p>There is no point of my existence since, without any sentient being from the universe, “goodness”, “badness”, and any purpose don't exist. However, this realization cannot be applied to low-level creatures fully, for it cannot reason. Since I share many instincts with those creatures, it cannot be fully applied to me as well. Therefore, my only hope is my subjective self.</p>

      <TooltipText text="value">
        <p>Every goal is not desirable. A prime minister faces a prime minister's problems; a civil servant faces a civil servant's problems. As a result, I tried to do nothing. However, I had to breathe after a few seconds and that was the first wisdom I attained. I knew that living by awareness was the only thing that could satisfy me, for it was the truest experience.</p>
      </TooltipText>
      , I want to create the work that describes the ideal personal life and society based on my own awareness, and create my own exemplary record about this way of life. If time and resources allowed, I will help others to do the same as well by, e.g., opening an affordable vegan restaurant.
