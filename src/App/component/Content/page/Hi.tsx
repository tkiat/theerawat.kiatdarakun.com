    <p>Hi, I am <span className="hi-highlight">Theerawat <span role="img" aria-hidden="true">{'\u{1F600}'}</span></span>. My lifelong pursuit is working on moral philosophical works based on awareness, memory, and logic. With an analytical mindset, I dissect my actions to determine if they align with reality. It is not surprising that I follow minimalist and low-impact lifestyles.</p>

    <p>However, I don't get money for that. My skills that might help my future job or career include study/work experience in Germany, English, (web) programming, Linux, an engineering background in telecommunications, and high school Math/Physics. I am currently looking for a full-time job somewhere in Thailand.</p>

    <p>This website serves as an outlet for what I want to tell the world about myself: character, story, activities, and resume. As I love to make records, the creation of this website brings me joy.</p>
