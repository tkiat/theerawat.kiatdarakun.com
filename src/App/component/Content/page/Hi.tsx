    <h3 className="highlight">True Meaning</h3>

    <div>
      The definitions of&nbsp;
      <TooltipText text="truths">
        One can be at least certain that anything made up out of thin air by oneself is not truth. Therefore, the broadest definition of truth, for a person, is every fact or belief except those made up out of thin air by that person. In this regard, one may consider the existence or the absence of God as truth (since one doesn't make either fact true by oneself), but one may not consider an object in one's imagination as truth.
      </TooltipText>
      &nbsp;and&nbsp;
      <TooltipText text="meaning">
        Only subjective consciousness may have meaning (i.e., a sense of importance) <i>on its own</i> as the universe without such cannot have any meaning. Therefore, in the broadest sense, subjective consciousness, together with things that can support or oppose it, may have meaning.
      </TooltipText>
      &nbsp;can be very broad. However, when combined, the&nbsp;
      <TooltipText text="broadest definition">
        One may think of true meaning as meaning bounded by truths. In the broadest sense, only subjective consciousness that can arise on its own (i.e., not made up out of thin air), together with things that can support or oppose it, may have true meaning. It includes hunger pains and instinctual feelings but not imaginary objects and attachment to sensory pleasures.
      </TooltipText>
      &nbsp;of true meaning seems manageable. The true meaning of life cannot go beyond one's interpretations of true meaning.
