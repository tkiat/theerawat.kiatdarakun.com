Such way of life is to live by the reality (i.e., the awareness), for it is the only thing that is not illusory (i.e., not created out of thin air).</p>

    <p>My life purpose is to live by the awareness and, if time and resources allowed, help others to do the same as well. With the analytical mindset, I dissect my actions to determine if they align with the reality. It is not surprising that I follow minimalist and low impact lifestyles.</p>

    <p>I have an engineering background in telecommunications who can communicate in English at ease in the workplace. My hobbies include (web) programming and Linux because they enable the freedom of presentation and computing. <span className="hi-highlight" role="img" aria-hidden="true">{'\u{1F60E}'}</span></p>
