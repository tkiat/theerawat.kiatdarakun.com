    <h3 className="highlight">True Meaning</h3>

    <div>
      The definitions of&nbsp;
      <TooltipText text="truths">
        Something is true when it conforms to reality. The only true thing I know is my capability to be conscious, while the only untrue thing I know is truth modified by my subjective consciousness since truth cannot be changed.
      </TooltipText>
      &nbsp;and&nbsp;
      <TooltipText text="meaning">
        Only subjective consciousness may have meaning (i.e., a sense of importance) <i>on its own</i> as the universe without such cannot have any meaning. Therefore, in the broadest sense, subjective consciousness, together with things that can support or oppose it, may have meaning.
      </TooltipText>
      &nbsp;can be very broad; however, when combined, the&nbsp;
      <TooltipText text="broadest definition">
        One may think of true meaning as meaning bounded by truths. Therefore, in the broadest sense, only subjective consciousness that is not modified by another subjective consciousness, together with things that can support or oppose such non-modified subjective consciousness, may have true meaning. For example, hunger pains and instinctual feelings may have true meaning but not with attachments on top of them.
      </TooltipText>
      &nbsp;of true meaning seems manageable. The true meaning of life constitutes (one's judgments and interpretations of) true meaning.
