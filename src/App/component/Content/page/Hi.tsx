    <p>Hi, I am <span className="hi-highlight">Theerawat <span role="img" aria-hidden="true">{'\u{1F600}'}</span></span>. My lifelong pursuit is working on moral philosophical works based on awareness, memory, and logic. With an analytical mindset, I dissect my actions to determine if they align with reality. It is not surprising that I follow minimalist and low-impact lifestyles. I am not planning to monetize this pursuit.</p>

    <p>I plan to sustain myself primarily by working full-time in Thailand. Relevant skills and knowledge include English, basic German, (web) programming, Linux, an engineering background in telecommunications, and high school Math/Physics. Previously, I have been a student and then an employee in Germany, a teaching and research assistant in Thailand, and a tutor in some places.</p>

    <p>This website serves as an outlet for what I want to tell the world about myself: character, story, and activities. As I love to make records, the creation of this website brings me joy.</p>
