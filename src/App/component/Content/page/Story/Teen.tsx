    <h1>13 - 19 Years</h1>
    <p>Everything was similar to my childhood except more responsibilities such as having to go to school myself. My mother tried to sell fried bananas and noodles but after a short while, she stopped. Of course, I helped her to do this stuff but not much since I also had to go to school. I joined the school nearby for 3 years. After that, I couldn't get to some schools I wanted so I continued my study at this same school until joining the university.</p>
    <p>During this period, the only things that interested me were video games, Mathematics and Physics. I also practiced guitar for a short while at my friend's house. Some might be interested in getting girlfriends or going to shopping malls but I didn't seem to care about that. I was self-motivated enough to try hard for the university exam and I luckily got a full unconditioned scholarship afterward.</p>
