    <p>My mind became blank after coming back to Thailand. The sky train near my house was finished. A new shopping mall emerged. Many things seemed to change yet nothing was really changed. Something fundamental always stays the same, people still enjoy and suffer. Many things that I didn't consider useful still engrossed so many people. I applied to only three jobs but didn't pass the interviews. This coupled with the fact that I just bought a new Ikea table and a new 27-inch monitor, video games became my new full-time job.

      . I deleted my video game accounts. I sold my Ipad and bought new cheaper phones. I quit buying freezer food and chips from 7-11 (a convenience store). I valued something lean and liberating more than something convenient and costly (in terms of money or environment). I read a few philosophy books. Now, I believe I am much wiser than I ever was before. I appreciate the given opportunity to introspect and now I have a clearer purpose to pursue.
