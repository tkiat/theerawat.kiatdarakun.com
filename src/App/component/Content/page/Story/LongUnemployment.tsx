    <p>I still didn't know what was going on in my life during this long unemployment except one thing: electricity cost. I didn't use an air-conditioner but I had a self-assembled PC with about 450W PSU. This was not much by the desktop standard but it was too prohibitive compared to a laptop. I also didn't like when it went off immediately after the power shortage occured. I could buy a power backup but it was too clunky.</p>
    <p>My old laptop that I purchased in 2008 came to my mind. It was VAIO VGNCS16S that costed me about 1000 USD. That was quite a lot of money but I liked it beauty (my only criterion at the time). With the notorious Microsoft Vista installed, it took me ages to boot successfully. I first replaced Vista with Ubuntu, the only Linux distribution I knew at the time. </p>
