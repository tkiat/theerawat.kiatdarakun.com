    <p>My life changed a lot more after I joined the university. There were ways too many things to do but I still mostly played video games. Again, many people were interested in getting a girlfriend but I didn't seem to care. Things that interested me outside of the study are volunteer camps (usually a few days), some exercises (swimming, jogging, badminton), and traveling (not that far, usually by free trains). Everything new was opened to me and I appreciated that.</p>

      The English curriculum broadened my horizon (in both technical knowledge and language senses). My faculty, at the time, had three choices: electronics, mechatronics, and communications. I preferred communications over the other two so I did an internship at&nbsp;

        It was a three-month internship in 2011 at Ladlumkaew, Thailand. I mainly observed the workers there do the tasks. There was a satellite installation training that I took for free. The final project is about socket programming between a signal generator and a spectrum analyzer. I chose VB.net to carry out the task. Why? Because it seemed easy to use! During the free time, I wrote a Mario game with VB.net as a practice.

        The thesis was organized into two parts: an abstract in the first semester and the execution in the second semester. I chose the uplink and downlink-related topic and I didn't actually know how to carry it out so I was the only one who changed the topic in the second semester. It was about the entropy of Thai text so I was proud to say that the Tripitaka was part of my thesis!

    <p>I still didn't really know what I wanted to do both personally and careerwise, but it seemed that I had only two options available: academia or corporate life. Both of which seemed to be good enough to me, even though I didn't have any personal goals.</p>
