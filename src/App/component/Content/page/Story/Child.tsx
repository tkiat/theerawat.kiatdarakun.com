    <h2>&lt; 13 Years</h2>
    <p>I was born in Thailand, 1990. My childhood was like almost everybody else's: play video games, watch cartoons, go to schools, and repeat. I remembered the technology was very basic at the time: I had a much slower internet with a dial-up connection and I rented videocassettes from the store to watch the movies. The road to my grandmother's house was obstructed by the large trucks because there was only one lane available.</p>
    <p>Everything was easy and fun. I didn't have to cook or go to school myself, my mother cooked for me and sent me to the school using her car, which my father bought. I didn't want anything except perhaps more episodes of cartoons or new games.</p>
    <p>My takeaway from my childhood is that the changing technology also changes our perception of the products, something that I once valued highly like a videocassette became useless since it is chunky as compared to CD. This is a comparison trap that makes us only value things relative to others but not what it is worth on their own.</p>
