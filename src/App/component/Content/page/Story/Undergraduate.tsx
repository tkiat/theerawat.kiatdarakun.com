    <h1>19 - 23 Years</h1>
    <p>My life began to change a bit more when I joined the university. By saying 'change' I mean in the sense of having more orientation in life towards a more sensible direction. I still knew nothing about what I wanted to do but it seems that I had only two options available: academia or corporate life. Both of which are good enough to me, even though I didn't have any personal goals.</p>
    <p>There were ways too many things to do but I still mostly played video games. Again, many people are interested in getting a girlfriend but I didn't seem to care.

During my free time, I write a Mario game with VB.net as a practice.

        The thesis was organized into two parts: students are expected to plan and create an abstract in the first semester and execute it in the second semester. I chose the uplink and downlink-related topic and I didn't actually know how to carry it out so I was the only one who change the topic in the second semester. It was about the entropy of Thai text so I was proud to say that the Tripitaka was part of my thesis!
