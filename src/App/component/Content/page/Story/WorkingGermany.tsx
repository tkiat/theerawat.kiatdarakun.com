      <MyReactTooltip id="tt-s-nidresden" text="National Instruments Dresden">
        A company in the east Germany acquired by National Instruments some time ago. It offers a testing solution mainly in the telecommunications area. People over there could speak German and also had German-like faces except one guy and some interns only.

    &nbsp;and got the 6-month&nbsp;
      <MyReactTooltip id="tt-s-internoffer" text="offer">
        All internships in Germany were required to be paid by law. The stipend ranged from 550 EUR to 1700 EUR from what I had heard. The interns in the west and south generally paid more than the east but the living cost is also higher. Obviously, it was harder to get one if you don't have a working German proficiency but you should be able to find it nonetheless with some efforts.

    . There were three other fellow&nbsp;

        My batchmate and also a short-term roommate. The other two come from Columbia and Egypt. All studied here in Germany (of course).

      <MyReactTooltip id="tt-s-buffets" text="buffets">
        One costs only 5 EUR and there was basically all you can eat including chickens, rice, and some soup. Another restaurant had similar meals but limited to a given container.

        The first apartment is a one (or two I don't remember) stay with some random russian people. My mother visited me shortly here and we went together in Prague. The second apartment I lives with German and French students where I knew that Crepe was way simpler than the one in Thailand.

      I was totally confused about the direction in life so I decided to find jobs in Berlin because it was my dream city to live in. I managed to find an&nbsp;

        It cost a whopping 600 EUR per month. It was very big and for two people actually but I had no other offer because they seemed prefer want a long-term stay. I intended to find jobs over here but this was indeed a crazy decision.

      . But I lost&nbsp;

        A bag containing a lot like 600 EUR, tablet, laptop, and many other things. This complicated the issue since the houseowner wanted the money right away. At that time, my mother was married to a guy in Norway and he very kindly gave (lend) me some money like 2000 EUR.

      <MyReactTooltip id="tt-s-berlinjob" text="job">
        <p>A job that valued Thai ability at Arvato Bertelsmann. I so far hadn't apply to any enginering job in Germany partly because I felt they don't need me except for cleaning and restaurant jobs but got rejected. I thought I would be needed there because I could speak Thai.</p>
        <p>A job is more like social science related, not engineering which is fine as I don't care much. I declined the full-time position and took 6 hours shift first. 9 months later, I converted to a full-time worker.</p>

        <p>Something in me changed. At first I thought I can have good work and continue until I die. The ultimate purpose in life in my mind at the time was happiness but I still didn't know what it was. I finally felt the struggling German people had.</p>
        <p>They usually pay for non-trivial amount of rent and also non-trivial amount of tax and perhaps a health insurance. They usually have pressure to find and retain the job or else they will face an unemployment nightmare. I give a deepest sympathy to homeless specifically during in the winter.</p>
        <p>I concluded that the life without rent and without much pressure is a better life.</p>
