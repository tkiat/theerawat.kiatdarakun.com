      <span>I was born in Thailand, 1990. My childhood was like almost everybody else's. I played video games, watched cartoons, went to schools, and repeated. Everything was easy and fun because my mother cooked for me and sent me to school using her car. She usually bought food for me and let me sit at the bottom of the seat and place food on the seat. I usually finished it before reaching the school.</span>
    </p>

    <p>I remembered the technology was very basic at the time. I had a much slower internet with a dial-up connection and I rented videocassettes from the store to watch the movies. I later noticed that something that I once valued highly like a videocassette became useless after the arrival of the CDs. This is a comparison trap that makes us only value things relative to others but not how much it is worth on its own.</p>
