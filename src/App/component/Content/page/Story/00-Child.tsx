    <p><a id="story-child"><b className="big highlight">&lt; 13 Years Old</b></a> â€” I was born in Thailand, 1990. My childhood was like almost everybody else's. I played video games, watched cartoons, went to schools, and repeated. Everything was easy and fun because my mother prepared everything for me and drove me to school by her car where I usually sat at the bottom of the seat and placed food on the seat. I usually finished it before reaching school.</p>

    <p>I remembered the technology was very basic at the time. I had much slower internet with a dial-up connection and I rented videocassettes from the store. I later noticed that something that I once valued highly like a videocassette became useless after the arrival of the CDs. This is a comparison trap that makes us only value things relative to others but not how much it is worth on its own.</p>
