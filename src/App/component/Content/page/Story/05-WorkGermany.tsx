      <TooltipText text="National Instruments Dresden">
        A company in the Dresden (in the east of Germany, it cost me around 16 EUR to Berlin from there!) acquired by National Instruments some time ago. It offers a testing solution mainly in the telecommunications area. People over there could speak German and also had German-like faces except one or two guys and some interns only.

    &nbsp;and got a 6-month&nbsp;
      <TooltipText text="offer">
        All internships in Germany were required to be paid by law. The stipend ranged from 550 EUR to 1700 EUR from what I had heard. The interns in the south of germany generally paid more than the east but the living cost is also higher. Obviously, it was harder to get one if you don't have a working German proficiency but you should be able to find it nonetheless with some effort.

    . There were three other fellow&nbsp;
      <TooltipText text="interns">
        My batchmate and also a short-term roommate. The other two come from Columbia and Egypt. All studied here in Germany (of course). Another batchmate of mine got a full-time job here also at the time I took an internship.

      &nbsp;here who went together places nearby such as&nbsp;
      <TooltipText text="Prague">
        We booked a cheap hostel (10 EUR each) and in the night we visited a bar. There was some dancing lady with a lingerie who made her piece tighter after I stared at her. I felt sleepy but the guard prevented me from doing so and told me to sleep at my home instead. I never understand why someone would want to visit such a place.
        <br /><br />
        We went to a very old restaurant in Prague where we were served big poultry food and beer. We went to a castle to inspect the heritage of something old I actually didn't know anything about. The beer was nice though. In fact, it was the best ever.

        Free sugary drinks, coffee, and tea. Snooker table and table football.

      &nbsp;but the best things were&nbsp;
      <TooltipText text="buffets">
        All you can eat including chickens, rice, and some soup cost me only 5 EUR, which was cheaper than many buffets in Thailand! Another restaurant offered similar meals but they were limited to a given container.

    <p>
      I still felt like I couldn't help those awesome German engineers much but I still wanted to stay there so I moved to nearby&nbsp;
      <TooltipText text="apartments">
        The first apartment is a stay with some random Russian people. My mother visited me shortly here and we went together to Prague. In the second apartment, I lived with German and French students where I knew that Crepe was actually way simpler than the ones in Thailand.

      . I was totally confused about the direction in life so I decided to find a job in Berlin because it was my dream city to live in. I managed to find an&nbsp;
      <TooltipText text="expensive one">
        It cost a whopping 600 EUR per month. It was very big and for two people but I had no other offer because they seemed to prefer a long-term stay. I intended to find jobs over here but this was indeed a crazy decision.
      </TooltipText>
      . But I lost&nbsp;
      <TooltipText text="my luggage">
        A bag containing a lot like 600 EUR, tablet, laptop, and many other things. This complicated the issue since the house owner wanted the money right away. At that time, my mother was married to a guy in Norway and he very kindly gave (lent) me some money like 2000 EUR. I contacted the police about this incident but no one contacted me back.

      &nbsp;when I was at a train station in Berlin. After&nbsp;
      <TooltipText text="my visit to a Buddhist temple">
        I visited the Buddhavihara temple in Berlin in the hope to find another accommodation or at least someone to share a room with. I found somebody but still didn't reach a conclusion. The next day I accidentally met the abbot of that temple since we both wanted to extend passports and he remembered me. I went with him to have some launch and then he suggested a nun who had an available apartment.

      , I stayed at a very&nbsp;

        It cost only 200 EUR per month. She said she has rented it since around 30 years ago and the price has remained low. There are three separate bedrooms. The kitchen was nicely furnished. The location was unbelievably convenient since there were a regular Turkish market just in front of the apartment and plenty of shops nearby.

      I took a plunge and enrolled two german&nbsp;
      <TooltipText text="courses">
        A B2 level German and also a speaking course. It was one of the best experiences ever since I passed Brandenburger Tor very often by bicycle. I felt I was a Berliner. I considered the course price to be cheap, at least cheaper than the one from Geothe Institute in Thailand.
      </TooltipText>
      . After a while, I got a&nbsp;
      <TooltipText text="job">
        It's a job that valued Thai language skills at Arvato Bertelsmann. I so far hadn't applied to any engineering job in Germany partly because I felt they didn't need me except for cleaning and restaurant jobs but got rejected. I thought I would be needed there because I could speak Thai.
        <br /><br />
        A job is more social-science related, not engineering at all which was fine as I didn't care much. I declined the full-time position and took part-time for 30 hours per week first. Nine months later, I converted to a full-time worker.

      &nbsp;around 8km from my apartment. I invited my father&nbsp;
      <TooltipText text="here">
        I paid everything for this visit including a two-way plane ticket. My father was amazed by the number of beers here. He like them a lot and drank a lot each day.
        <br /><br />
        Then we went to Prague. The hostel we booked had no free place anymore so we got the upgrade to the private room for free! As I did with my fellow interns in my previous trip, we ate at the same restaurant and visited the same castle but my father felt really tired after the trip. I took my father for a beer in a bar in Prague which became his most favorite beer ever.

        Just sit in front of a computer for a long time. The company has some perks like half-price health insurance and train ticket but I rejected the latter because I prefer my bicycle (the workpace was around 8km from my apartment). It was the best ever experience to put a beer bottle from the supermarket into my bicycle bottle holder to get it very cold naturally after I reached my place.
        <br /><br />
        Half of the time I worked a night shift and finished at 10 pm. It was dark and cold on the way back but not that much. My Jack Wolfskin jacket was always reliable.

      &nbsp; was unbelievable and new. However, the&nbsp;
      <TooltipText text="monotony">
        Something in me changed. At first, I thought I can have good work and continue until I die. The ultimate purpose in life in my mind at the time was happiness but I still didn't know what it was. I finally felt the struggling some German people had.
        <br /><br />
        They usually pay for a non-trivial amount of rent and tax and perhaps also the health insurance. They usually have pressure to find and retain a job or else they will face an unemployment nightmare. Mini-jobs exist but that was just enough to get by. I give the deepest sympathy to the homeless specifically during the winter. I concluded that life without rent and without much pressure is a better life.

      &nbsp;creeped in and I decided not to extend the contract. Not long before the end of the job, my mother visited me&nbsp;
      <TooltipText text="from Norway">
        She married a guy there.
      </TooltipText>
      . I also later paid her a&nbsp;
      <TooltipText text="visit">
        She lived in Kristiansand, Norway. The weather at that time was snowy and the town was crowded. We went with her husband on a ferryboat to Denmark where he bought an art piece and we visited an underwater museum.
        <br /><br />
        Norway was an interesting place with very high social welfare. At the same time, the fee when people misbehaved was very high. The food was very expensive but the nature there was lovely. Some people caught lobsters themselves and some picked berries in the wild.

      , but I had to&nbsp;
      <TooltipText text="sleep">
        Because of the weather, I got free food from the airline at both airports in Norway and Amsterdam. I was entitled to a free hotel also in Amsterdam but there was no vacancy nearby. So, I slept in the airport at the spot near the heater. To my surprise, many people did the same. It was one of the best sleep ever (due to a central heating radiator nearby and excitement).
