        Sure, it tells me to change my position when I ache, but what about eating? I currently need to harm other sentient beings for food (even vegan food due to insects), which is a conflict since my awareness tells me that all beings want to survive (as, e.g., their bodies heals themselves). Should I commit suicide or continue living?

      &nbsp;using only awareness. I then examined everything from scratch about what action I could take. Everybody has to make at least one subjective decision if he/she wants to commit suicide or live. Those who decides to live has yet to make at least another subjective decision (or not make any decision at all) about how to live. My survival instincts nudged me to live, and I had undescribable strong passion to live by true meaning.

      , <b>only subjective consciousness that matters and reflects truths, together with things that can support or oppose it, constitutes the true meaning of life</b>. People may have different opinions about truths and what kind of subjective consciousness matters, but I regard truths as my sensory perception and widely accepted scientific research and subjective consciousness that matters as the one that can arise on its own.

    <p>I then became free from all dogmas and spiritual/religious thoughts since I realized what constitutes the true meaning of life. I want to live by this realization and produce works about it. Since the word “true” and “matter” are in the eye of the beholder, I can only assume the common definitions that I believe most people hold in my works.</p>
