        Sure, it tells me to change my position when I ache, but what about eating? I currently need to harm other sentient beings for food (even vegan food due to insects), which is a conflict since my awareness tells me that all beings want to survive (as, e.g., their bodies heals themselves). Should I commit suicide or continue living?

      &nbsp;using only awareness. I then examined everything from scratch. The most fundamental subjective decision, for anybody, is to live or commit suicide, and those who live may subjectively decide how to live. My survival instincts nudged me to live, and I had a strong passion to live by true meaning.

      , I concluded that <b>only subjective consciousness that matters and reflects truths, together with things that can support or oppose it, constitutes the true meaning of life</b>. People may have different opinions, but I regard my sensory perception and widely accepted scientific research as sources of truths and subjective consciousness that matters as the one that can arise on its own. This decision aligns most with my body and its capabilities.

    <p>I then gained a bird's eye view of the true meaning since I realized what constitutes it. Next, I want to live by my interpretations and judgments about this realization and produce works about it. Since the word “true” and “matter” are in the eye of the beholder, I can only assume the common definitions that I believe most people hold in my works.</p>
