        Sure, it tells me to change my position when I ache, but what about eating? I currently need to harm other sentient beings for food (even vegan food due to insects), which is a conflict since my awareness tells me that all beings want to survive (as, e.g., their bodies heals themselves). Should I commit suicide or continue living?

        Everything that truly matters lies within sentient beings. Why? Without sentient beings, who's gonna complain after Saturn crashes with a moon right?

        Everything that truly matters is limited to existing qualities or flows inside sentient beings. Why? “truly” in “truly matters” means something that is not made-up. For example, I would think a computer that I are seeing is “true”, unlike a computer in a fairy tale. Anything that is not made-up can only be discovered through six senses, not anything in the mind. Though, I can use memory and denotation, for example, to refer to past perceptions. They are still truths, for they don't change anything.

        Everything that truly matters is limited to existing flows, not qualities, inside sentient beings. Why? Existing qualities within a sentient being themselves (like hands, white skin, etc.) are just mere states and cannot be reversed, and thus they cannot matter. On the other hand, existing flows can be reversed, and thus they can “matter”.

      &nbsp;considerations, I concluded that <strong>the only things that <i>can</i> truly matter, to any sentient being, lie within the flows inherent in all sentient beings</strong>.

    <p>
      This realization led to my rejection of all dogmas, beliefs, religions, spiritual practices, etc., as irrelevant. They often focused on the perceived truths (e.g, by using awareness) or the elimination of things that don't truly matter (like ego or greed), but none of them focused on what truly matters. Many people are blind to this realization, and I shall live by and create works upon what <i>can</i> truly matters for the benefits of beings.
