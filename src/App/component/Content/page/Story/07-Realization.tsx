        Sure, it tells me to change my position when I ache, but what about eating? I currently need to harm other sentient beings for food (even vegan food due to insects), which is a conflict since my awareness tells me that all beings want to survive (as, e.g., their bodies heals themselves). Should I commit suicide or continue living?

      &nbsp;using only awareness. I then examined everything from scratch. Most fundamentally, one has to subjectively decide to either live or commit suicide, and one who lives may subjectively decide how to live. After a long self-introspection, I realized that my survival instincts nudged me to live and I had a strong passion to live by true meaning.

      Based on these definitions of&nbsp;
      <TooltipText text="meaning">
        Meaning is a sense of importance, which requires a <i>conscious</i> inclination toward or against something. It seems only emotions, sensory experiences, and thoughts can create meaning.

      <TooltipText text="meaning of life">
        Meaning of life is a sense of importance associated with life, which may be perceived by any capable entity (this can be that life itself or one or more other entities). The definitions of life and other entities depend on knowledge and beliefs: some believe in souls; some believe in God; some believe only in their ideas of the physical world; some believe that only their consciousness exists.

      <TooltipText text="the true meaning of life">
        <div>Imagine I create a unique blue unicorn named Bob. Even though Bob is fictional, its true color is blue. Painting it using a different color other than blue makes that a quality of it, but that quality is not true. The same applies to the true meaning of life. It is the meaning associated with the essence of life itself, no matter if life is fictional or not.</div>

        <br />

        <div>Things that can create meaning, namely emotions, sensory experiences, and thoughts, are parts of life; however, thoughts alone are very short-lived and thus they cannot associate with the essence of life at a later stage. For this reason, living by true meaning is to follow emotions and sensory experiences but not thoughts (or emotions created by thoughts) alone.</div>

      &nbsp;can take me out of the darkness of ignorance. I wanted to live by my interpretations and judgments about true meaning of life and produce relevant works.</p>
