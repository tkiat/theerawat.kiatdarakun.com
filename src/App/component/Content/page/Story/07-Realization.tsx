        Sure, it tells me to change my position when I ache, but what about eating? I currently need to harm other sentient beings for food (even vegan food due to insects), which is a conflict since my awareness tells me that all beings want to survive (as, e.g., their bodies heals themselves). Should I commit suicide or continue living?

      &nbsp;using only awareness. I then examined everything from scratch. The most fundamental decision I could make is to live or commit suicide, and those who live may decide how to live. Both decisions are subjective. After a long self-introspection, I realized that my survival instincts nudged me to live and I had a strong passion to live by true meaning.

        Only subjective consciousness may have meaning (i.e., a sense of importance) <i>on its own</i> as the universe without such cannot have any meaning. Therefore, in the broadest sense, subjective consciousness, together with things that can support or oppose it, may have meaning.

        <div>Subjectively modified sensory perception cannot yield another sensory perception. The same applies to feeling, emotion, and memory. However, subjectively modified thoughts can yield another thought. Therefore, given that all these kinds of subjective consciousness are true, the modified versions of them are not true except for thoughts.</div>

        <div>One who does not know the absolute truths cannot certainly consider any subjective consciousness as truth. Therefore, in the broadest and most general sense, only thoughts and non-modified subjective consciousness, together with things that can support or oppose it, may have true meaning.</div>

      &nbsp;of true meaning seems manageable. Realizing that the true meaning of life constitutes (one's judgments and interpretations of) true meaning, I finally saw possible paths out of the darkness of ignorance. I wanted to live by my interpretations and judgments about this realization and produce works about it.</p>
