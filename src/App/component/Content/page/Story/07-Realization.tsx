      <b className="big-text highlight">32 Years Old (Satisfactory Realization)</b> — After a while, I realized that awareness alone cannot guide me how to deal with&nbsp;
      <TooltipText text="inevitable conflicts">
        Sure, it tells me to change my position when I ache, but what about eating? I currently need to harm other sentient beings for food (even vegan food due to insects), which is a conflict since my awareness tells me that all beings want to survive (as, e.g., their bodies heals themselves). Should I commit suicide or continue living?
      </TooltipText>
      . I then decided to begin from scratch once again. I can either commit suicide or live. If I decide to live, I can only follow either the true or made-up meaning of life, both, or neither of them. My survival instinct nudged me not to commit suicide, and my innate curiosity drove me to live by true meaning. Made-up meaning is straightforward (e.g., music, better life, fame, money), but what about true meaning?</p>

    <p>True meaning is vague, so I focused on the most fundamental element of it, namely “a thing that can matter”. After this&nbsp;
    <TooltipText text="examination">
      <ol>
        <li>Without sentience, nothing can matter on its own.</li>
        <li>Therefore, things that can matter on its own lies within sentience.</li>
        <li>And things that can truly matter on its own lies within sentience that reflects truth.</li>
        <li>Things that can truly matter on its own are not separable with things that can support or oppose it. Together, they are “things that can truly matter”.</li>
      </ol>
    </TooltipText>
    , I concluded that <b>things that can truly matter lies within sentience that reflects truth, along with things that can support or oppose it</b>. This is a fundamental element that <i>can</i> lead to true meaning of life. What is the truth then? I don't know exact truths because of my limited capabilities. Therefore, its definition depends on one's beliefs and interpretations.</p>

    <p>I then became free from all dogmas, spiritual thoughts, etc. Many of them may offer wisdom (like the elimination of ego), but none actually focused on things that can truly matter. I want to live by this realization and produce works about it. Since the word “true” and “matter” are in the eye of the beholder, I can only assume the common definitions that I believe most people hold in my works.</p>
