        Sure, it tells me to change my position when I ache, but what about eating? I currently need to harm other sentient beings for food (even vegan food due to insects), which is a conflict since my awareness tells me that all beings want to survive (as, e.g., their bodies heals themselves). Should I commit suicide or continue living?

      . In fact, a degree of subjectiveness has to be added on top of the truths in order to resolve such conflicts. This is not unwise, for I have to choose. This changed the question from “what are truths?” to “what truly matter?”. After the&nbsp;

        Everything that truly matters lies within sentient beings. Why? Without sentient beings, who's gonna complain after Saturn crashes with a moon right?

      <TooltipText text="second">
        Everything that truly matters is limited to existing qualities or flows inside sentient beings. Why? “Truly” in “truly matters” means something that is not made-up. For example, I would think a computer that I are seeing is “true”, unlike a computer in a fairy tale. Anything that is not made-up can only be discovered through six senses, not anything in the mind. Though, I can use memory and denotation, for example, to refer to past perceptions. They are still truths, for they don't change anything.

        Everything that truly matters is limited to existing flows, not qualities, inside sentient beings. Why? Existing qualities within a sentient being themselves (like hands, white skin, etc.) are just mere states and cannot be reversed, and thus they cannot matter. On the other hand, existing flows can be reversed, and thus they can “matter”.

      &nbsp;considerations, I concluded that <strong>the only things that <i>can</i> truly matter, to any sentient being, lie within the flows inherent in all sentient beings</strong>.

       Since the word “can” and “matter” are of subjective kinds, I can only create possible, non-judgmental interpretations from this realization, all of which are equally valid as they all stem from what truly matters. I became free from all dogmas, beliefs, religions, spiritual practices, etc. Many of them may offer wisdom (like the elimination of ego and greed), but none actually focused on what truly matters. Some people are unaware to this basic realization, and I shall live by and create works upon what <i>can</i> truly matters for the benefits of beings.
