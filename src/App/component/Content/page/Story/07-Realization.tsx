        Sure, it tells me to change my position when I ache, but what about eating? I currently need to harm other sentient beings for food (even vegan food due to insects), which is a conflict since my awareness tells me that all beings want to survive (as, e.g., their bodies heals themselves). Should I commit suicide or continue living?

      &nbsp;using only awareness. I then examined everything from scratch. The most fundamental decision I could make is to live or commit suicide, and those who live may decide how to live. Both decisions are subjective. After a long self-introspection, I realized that my survival instincts nudged me to live and I had a strong passion to live by true meaning.

      The definitions of&nbsp;
      <TooltipText text="truths">
        One can be at least certain that anything made up out of thin air by oneself is not truth. Therefore, the broadest definition of truth, for a person, is every fact or belief except those made up out of thin air by that person. In this regard, one may consider the existence or the absence of God as truth (since one doesn't make either fact true by oneself), but one may not consider an object in one's imagination as truth.

        Only subjective consciousness may have meaning (i.e., a sense of importance) <i>on its own</i> as the universe without such cannot have any meaning. Therefore, in the broadest sense, subjective consciousness, together with things that can support or oppose it, may have meaning.

        One may think of true meaning as meaning bounded by truths. In the broadest sense, only subjective consciousness that can arise on its own (i.e., not made up out of thin air), together with things that can support or oppose it, may have true meaning. It includes hunger pains and instinctual feelings but not imaginary objects and attachment to sensory pleasures.

      &nbsp;of true meaning seems manageable. Realizing that the true meaning of life constitutes (one's judgments and interpretations of) true meaning, I finally saw the possible path out of the darkness of ignorance. I wanted to live by my interpretations and judgments about this realization and produce works about it.</p>
