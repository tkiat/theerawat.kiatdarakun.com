        Sure, it tells me to change my position when I ache, but what about eating? I currently need to harm other sentient beings for food (even vegan food due to insects), which is a conflict since my awareness tells me that all beings want to survive (as, e.g., their bodies heals themselves). Should I commit suicide or continue living?

      &nbsp;using only awareness. I then examined everything from scratch. The most fundamental decision I could make is to live or commit suicide, and those who live may decide how to live. Both decisions are subjective. After a long self-introspection, I realized that my survival instincts nudged me to live and I had a strong passion to live by true meaning.

      I aspire to live by the true meaning, and I don't know any absolute truth. Therefore, I can only live the least illusory path where I minimize certainly illusory things, i.e., made-up things without any basis. True meaning requires truths and meaning (i.e., importance).

Common sources of truth that many people hold include sensory perception and widely-accepted scientific research.</li>
          <li><b className="highlight">Importance</b>. Important things are everything that is neither made up nor without any basis, and only subjective consciousness that can arise on its own can satisfy these criteria.</li>
        </ul>
      </TooltipText>. One may extend truths through pure transformations (like denotation and logic) and importance by discovering what can support or oppose important things. The true meaning of life cannot go beyond such extensions.

    <p>I was finally satisfied with my abstract journey since I had gained a bird's eye view of my existence. Next, I wanted to live by my interpretations and judgments about this realization and produce works about it.</p>
