        I became utterly confused after coming back to Thailand.&nbsp;
        <MyTooltip text="Many things">
          The sky train near my house was finished; a new shopping mall emerged.
        </MyTooltip>
        &nbsp;seemed to change, yet&nbsp;
        <MyTooltip text="nothing">
          People still enjoy and suffer, and they still do stuff they think they need to do. Many things that I didn't consider useful anymore still engrossed so many people.
        </MyTooltip>
        &nbsp;was really changed. After a month, I applied to only three jobs but didn't pass all the interviews so I stopped my job search and then played video games like a&nbsp;
        <MyTooltip text="full-time job">
          I bought a new IKEA table and a new 27-inch monitor, making it easier to engross myself in video games. I was then a mere consumer who didn't produce anything.
        </MyTooltip>
        &nbsp;for more than a year. One day, I noticed that my self-assembled PC was&nbsp;
        <MyTooltip text="problematic">
          It incurred much electricity cost and was also prone to the occasional power shortage.
        </MyTooltip>
        , and thus my very old&nbsp;
        <MyTooltip text="laptop">
          It was VAIO VGNCS16S that cost me (to be more precise, my father) about 1000 USD in 2008. That was quite a lot of money but I liked its beauty (my only criterion at the time). With the notorious Microsoft Vista, it took me ages to boot successfully.
        </MyTooltip>
        &nbsp;came to my mind. I installed Void Linux on it, and the performance was an eye-opener for me.
      </span>
    </p>

    <p>
      I then became much more interested in tinkering with software than playing video games, so I stopped playing games (intensively) ever since and replaced my PC with two used&nbsp;
      <MyTooltip text="Thinkpad X200">
        They allowed me to install open-source WiFi firmware and bootloader (Libreboot then coreboot). The proprietary counterparts might contain spyware because no one can see the code.
      </MyTooltip>
      . My perspective was broaden, and I began to value&nbsp;
      <MyTooltip text="freedom">
        Freedom, to me, is the ability to do anything; however, it cannot compromise others' freedom. I began to use free software and had a thought of using less waste and going vegan, though I still thought of veganism as a bit “too much”.
      </MyTooltip>
      &nbsp;over convenience. I immersed myself in (web) programming and Linux, thinking that they will give me freedom I want. My desire for freedom extended to other beings as well. This was when I began to perceive sufferings of everything around me.
    </p>

    <p>
      I then realized that we are frequently ignorant to sufferings, which in turn led to the strong urge to discover why (and how) I should live before beginning my job search again. For almost a year, I examined some philosophical thoughts and&nbsp;
      <MyTooltip text="introspected">
        Why should I eat or survive? Does a tiger have right to kill other animals? What is good and bad? Do we have objective life purposes? Does God exist? Does rebirth exist? ...
      </MyTooltip>
      &nbsp;about the fundamental nature of things. I finally came to the conclusion that life purpose can be&nbsp;
      <MyTooltip text="anything">
        Since goodness and badness don't inhere the universe and humans have capable faculties to set anything as a goal, e.g., fame, nirvana, heaven, sensual pleasure, life purpose can be anything.
      </MyTooltip>
      . However, it is the&nbsp;
      <MyTooltip text="wisest">
        Being wise is having the ability to make good judgments. Since the judgment is better with more evidence, it is the wisest to make a judgement based on what actually exists, not something created out of thin air. In other words, it is the wisest to use the awareness to guide my life.
      </MyTooltip>
      &nbsp;to use the awareness to guide my life. I long for the truth, and this is the answer I have been searching for.</p>

    <p>
      While it can take forever to uncover everything using my awareness, I now believe I am much wiser than I ever was before, for I have examined my life including the darkness that resides within me. I now know the reasons behind&nbsp;
      <MyTooltip text="many actions">
        For example, I should turn on a fan when my body needs it, and one sign for this is sweat.
      </MyTooltip>
      &nbsp;I appreciate the given opportunity to introspect. I now know why and how to live.
    </p>

    <p>Why should I live? Using my awareness, I conclude that my body wants to survive (as it heals itself), and the same applies to other beings as well. Since I need to kill other beings for food, both decisions (to commit suicide and continue to hurt others) neither fully respect nor disrespect the reality. The only way to prevent this dilemma is to prevent myself from being born in the first place, which is impossible. Therefore, I must choose one of these two choices.</p>

    <p>The fact that I was still writing this paragraph showed that I decided to live. The next question is then “how should I live?”. Life purpose can be anything, but the wisest way of life is to live by the reality, i.e., using the awareness as a guide. I want to leave all the details for now. The thing is, I've got a satisfactory answer (i.e., still not knowledge) of why and how to live. It is now reasonable to find job and continue to exist.</p>
