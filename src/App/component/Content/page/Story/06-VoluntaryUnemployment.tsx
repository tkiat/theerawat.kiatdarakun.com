        I spent money and did the thesis in Aachen (that was still not as worth as free education I received). I then proceeded to work in Berlin that required Thai language, and therefore I didn't feel like I took away jobs from Germans.

        I bought a new IKEA table and a new 27-inch monitor, making it easier to immerse myself in video games. I was then a mere consumer who didn't produce anything.

        One day, I noticed that my self-assembled PC incurred much electricity cost and it was also prone to the occasional power shortage. I then had a memory flashback of a VAIO VGNCS16S laptop that cost me (actually my father) about 1000 USD in 2008. That was quite a lot of money but I liked its beauty (my only criterion at the time). With the notorious Microsoft Vista, it took me ages to boot successfully.

        I installed Void Linux on it, and the performance was an eye-opener for me. I then became much more interested in tinkering with software than playing video games, so I stopped playing games (intensively) ever since and replaced my PC with two used Thinkpad X200. They are compatible with open-source WiFi firmware and bootloader (like libreboot and coreboot), which I preferred than the proprietary counterparts (due to potential spyware).

        Freedom, to me, is the ability to do anything; however, it cannot compromise others' freedom. I began to use free software and had a thought of using less waste and going vegan, though I still thought of veganism as a bit “too much”.

      &nbsp;over convenience. I then immersed myself in (web) programming and Linux.

      After two years of learning (mainly coding), I then realized that I have been ignorant to sufferings. This led to the strong urge to discover why (and how) I should live before beginning my job search again. For almost a year, I&nbsp;

      &nbsp;about the fundamental nature of things. I finally came to the conclusion that life purpose can be&nbsp;
      <TooltipText text="anything">
        Since goodness and badness don't inhere the universe and humans have capable faculties to set anything as a goal, e.g., fame, nirvana, heaven, sensual pleasure, life purpose can be anything.

        Being wise is having the ability to make good judgments. Since the judgment is better with more evidence, it is the wisest to make a judgement based on what actually exists, not something created out of thin air. In other words, it is the wisest to use the awareness to guide my life. I am calling what I am aware of “truth”.
      </TooltipText>
      &nbsp;to use the awareness to guide my life. I long for truths, and this seemed to be the answer I have been searching for.
