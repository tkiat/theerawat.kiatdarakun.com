    <p><b className="big-text highlight">13 - 19 Years Old (High School)</b> â€” Everything was similar to my childhood except more responsibilities such as having to go to school myself. My mother tried to sell fried bananas and noodles but after a short while, she stopped. Of course, I helped her to do this stuff but not much since I also had to go to school. I joined the same school nearby for 6 years until joining the university.</p>

    <p>During this period, the main things that interested me were video games, Mathematics and Physics. I participated in 3 POSN physics camps and also practiced guitar for a short while at my friend's house. Some might be interested in getting girlfriends or going to shopping malls but I didn't seem to care about that. I was self-motivated enough to try hard for the university exam and I luckily got a full unconditioned scholarship afterward. Not long before finishing the school, I had been a tutor for high-school students in some places. It's my first paid job ever.</p>
