    <div>I was still very ignorant about the direction in life but I felt that pursuing a Master's degree abroad was the best investment to do. And apart from the Cambodia border, I hadn't been outside of my country before. I sent the applications to RWTH Aachen and TU Muenchen in Germany because of the&nbsp;

        This was actually quite useless because many German universities have high standard. The area of study and thesis topics are more important in my opinion.

      . The one I got accepted was RWTH Aachen. This meant I didn't have to pay any tuition fees except the&nbsp;
      <MyReactTooltip id="tt-s-rwthfee" text="social contribution fee">
        It costed me around 220 EUR per semester. This granted me free transport (bus, train) within the Nordrhein-Westfalen. The area was quite big which includes Duesseldorf, Cologne, and Dortmund. I also could take the university cafeteria which was usually cheaper than eating outside.

      . The application for RWTH Aachen required a bit of&nbsp;
      <MyReactTooltip id="tt-s-rwthprep" text="preparation">
        I needed to send my IELTS scores and also open letters of recommendations. The annoying part was that they also require me taking GRE (which costed around 180 USD). I was so lazy that I took only one day to prepare it. The score was not nice except the qualitative section. I had to send applications via mail also.

      On the first day of arrival, I had the appointment with&nbsp;
      <MyReactTooltip id="tt-s-twostudents" text="two kind Thai students">
        One met me at Cologne and one took a taxi with me from Aachen Hofbahnhof (train station) to my room. I just met an unknown German lady (probably like 50 year old) who stood with me at Hofbahnhof because she said it was dangerous (not true in my opinion).

      &nbsp;who will take me to my single-room apartment. I adapted quickly to a new&nbsp;

        <p>where I have to cook myself. I always bought pre-made food in Thailand but it was prohibitive to buy them in Germany (it's like 1 vs 5 EUR). The average meal cost in Germany is 1.5 EUR only if I cook myself.</p>
        <p>The climate was quite the opposite of Thailand where I had to heat my room instead of cooling it. My cloth needed to be thick during the cold winter when I could sometimes expect snow.</p>

      <MyReactTooltip id="tt-s-drilander" text="Dreilaenderpunkt">
        <p>It is simply the meeting point of three countries: Germany, The Netherlands, and Belgium. It took me around 1.5 hours by foot from my apartment. The view was nice and the path to it had some farming and horses. The experience was totally priceless. I visited this place many times (&gt; 5).</p>

        This was when I realized more than half was Indian. A very little chinese was here in my batch which was a little surprising. There was only one German. If you want to meet German in class, take a class in German, not in English.

        <p>I took all the courses as many as possible because I didn't have anything better to do. The exam here was taken only one time at the end of the semester and very short (15 minute oral exam or 1.5 hours written exam).</p>
        <p>In my opinion, if you believe you cannot process the exam quickly, don't come. You will be rejected from the university if you fail the exam of the same course three times in a row.</p>
