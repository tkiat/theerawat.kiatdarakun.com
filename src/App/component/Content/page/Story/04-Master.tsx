        One met me at Cologne and another one took a taxi with me from Aachen Hofbahnhof (train station) to my room (which I paid the deposit and the rent in advance). I just met an unknown German lady (probably around 50 years old) who stood with me at Hofbahnhof because she said it was dangerous (not true in my opinion).

        I had to cook myself. I always bought pre-made food in Thailand but it was more prohibitive to buy them in Germany than cooking it myself (it's like 1.5 EUR vs 5 EUR). The climate was quite the opposite of Thailand where I had to heat my room instead of cooling it. My cloth needed to be thick during the cold winter when I could sometimes expect snow.

        It is simply the meeting point of three countries: Germany, The Netherlands, and Belgium. It took me around 1.5 hours by foot from my apartment. The view was nice and the path to it had some farming and horses. The experience was totally priceless. I visited this place many times (&gt; 5).

        This was when I realized more than half was Indian. A very few Chinese were here in my batch which was a little surprising. There was only one German. If you want to meet more Germans in a class, you probably want to take a class in German, not in English.

        I took all the courses as many as possible because I didn't have anything better to do. The exam here was taken only one time at the end of the semester and very short (15-minute oral exam or 1.5 hours written exam). In my opinion, if you believe you cannot process the exam quickly, don't come. You will be rejected from the university if you fail the exam of the same course three times in a row.

        The membership required participants to enroll in the introductory course first which lasted a few days and cost me 30 EUR. I, along with the other 5 German students, were introduced to how to use each machine but the trainer had to speak to me in English. The bathroom was full of naked people but I used a separate room myself because I didn't want to hurt their ego. Smaller is better.

        I won the touring bike from the auction on eBay for 140 EUR. It was cheap given the quality: many gears, water bottle holder, two seats, and 28-inch wheel size. I took the free train to Duesseldorf where I met the seller. In Germany, you have to pay for a ticket for a bicycle if you carry it on a train. Make sense!

        I was about to get punished by the train officer that day but luckily a German guy talked with the office and somehow I had to pay only 6 EUR bicycle fee, not an additional, probably around 40 EUR, punishment fee. I was fined 3 times with my bicycle usage. The first time was for the absence of rear light, and the other twos were too much speed.

        Maastricht is a beautiful city in the Netherlands. Shopping malls and the river port attracted me a lot. They were usually full of people and I went there more than 15 times! The best part was the quality of the bicycle road to the city. It took me 1.5 hours to reach this 35 km destination. There was an American war memorial on the way to the city.

        Monschau is a very beautiful town with some small rivers and a castle. Barred the constant flux of visitors, it was very nice to live there. It took me almost 2 hours by bike because of the slope but I spent only 1 hour on the way back. I went there two times by bike, alone.
