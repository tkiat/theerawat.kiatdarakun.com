      I became utterly confused after coming back to Thailand.&nbsp;
      <MyTooltip text="Many things">
        The sky train near my house was finished. A new shopping mall emerged.
      </MyTooltip>
      &nbsp;seemed to change, yet&nbsp;
      <MyTooltip text="nothing">
        People still enjoy and suffer, and they still do stuff they think they need to do. Many things that I didn't consider useful anymore still engrossed so many people.
      </MyTooltip>
      &nbsp;was really changed. After a month, I applied to only three jobs but didn't pass all the interviews so I stopped my job search. This failure, coupled with the fact that I just bought a new IKEA table and a new 27-inch monitor, made video games my new&nbsp;

         I was then a mere consumer who didn't produce anything.
      </MyTooltip>
      &nbsp;for more than a year. One day, I noticed that my self-assembled PC was actually&nbsp;
      <MyTooltip text="problematic">
        It incurred much electricity cost and was also prone to the occasional power shortage.

      , and thus my very old&nbsp;

        It was VAIO VGNCS16S that cost me (to be more precise, my father) about 1000 USD in 2008. That was quite a lot of money but I liked its beauty (my only criterion at the time). With the notorious Microsoft Vista, it took me ages to boot successfully.
      </MyTooltip>
      &nbsp;came to my mind.
    </p>

    <p>
      I first replaced Microsoft Vista that comes with it with Ubuntu and then Void Linux. The Void Linux was performant and that was an eye-opener for me. I became interested in this liberating piece of software (Linux) and abandoned my PC. I sold my PC afterward and bought two used&nbsp;
      <MyTooltip text="Thinkpad X200">
        They allowed me to install open-source WiFi firmware and bootloader (Libreboot then coreboot). The proprietary counterparts might contain spyware because no one can see the code.
      </MyTooltip>
      . I was much more interested in tinkering with software than playing video games, so I stopped playing games (intensively) ever since.
    </p>

    <p>
      I began to value something&nbsp;
      <MyTooltip text="lean and liberating">
        I replaced my iPad with a cheaper tablet and quitted buying frozen food and chips from the convenience store.
      </MyTooltip>
      &nbsp;than something convenient and costly. I began to perceive sufferings of everything around me. My perspective was broaden, and I knew I wanted “freedom”. I immersed myself in (web) programming and Linux, thinking that they will give me freedom I want. My desire for freedom extends to other beings as well. I has a thought of using less waste and going vegan, though I still thought of veganism as “too much”.

    <p>This eventually led to the strong urge to discover the truth of the universe. I decided to discover the “why?” to live before searching for a job. For almost a year, I read some philosophy blog posts and also introspected a lot about the fundamental nature of everything. Why should I eat or survive? Does a tiger have right to kill other animals? What is good and bad? Do we have objective life purposes? Does God exist? Does rebirth exist?</p>

    <p>I asked all these questions to discover why (and how) I should live. I finally came to the conclusion that the life purpose can be anything (fame, nirvana, heaven, a lot of sensual pleasure, etc.) since goodness and badness don't inhere the universe. However, it is the wisest to use the awareness to guide my life, for it is the only thing that I don't create out of thin air. I long for the truth, and the wisest way of life is the answer I have been searching for.</p>

    <p>
      I have used my awareness to observe everything around me, especially the darkness that resides within me. While it can take forever to uncover eveyrthing, I now believe I am much wiser than I ever was before, for I have examined my life greatly. I now know the reasons behind&nbsp;
      <MyTooltip text="each action">
      </MyTooltip>
      &nbsp;

    I appreciate the given opportunity to introspect. I now have a clearer purpose to pursue.</p>
