      <b className="big highlight">32 Years Old (Realization)</b> — After a while, I realized that awareness alone cannot always dictate what I should do. Sure, it tells me to change my position when I ache, but what about eating? I currently need to harm other sentient beings for food (even vegan food due to insects), which is a conflict since my awareness tells me that all beings want to survive (as it, e.g., heals itself). Should I commit suicide or continue living? As a result, I threw everything I have thought away again. One day, I got an epiphany that it is the wisest not to seek truths but instead ask for “what truly matter?” and live by it because of this&nbsp;
      <TooltipText text="reason">
        TODO
        I am a sentient being so every of my action and thought is though subjective lenses.

      .

        Everything that truly matters lies within sentient beings. Why? Without sentient beings, who's gonna complain after Saturn crashes with a moon right?

      ,&nbsp;
      <TooltipText text="second">
        Everything that truly matters is limited to existing qualities or flows inside sentient beings. Why? “truly” in “truly matters” means something that is not made-up. For example, I would think a computer that I are seeing is “true”, unlike a computer in a fairy tale. Anything that is not made-up can only be discovered through six senses, not anything in the mind. Though, I can use memory and denotation, for example, to refer to past perceptions. They are still truths, for they don't change anything.
      </TooltipText>
      , then&nbsp;
      <TooltipText text="third">
        Everything that truly matters is limited to existing flows, not qualities, inside sentient beings. Why? Existing qualities within a sentient being themselves (like hands, white skin, etc.) are just mere states and cannot be reversed, and thus they cannot matter. On the other hand, existing flows can be reversed, and thus they can “matter”.
      </TooltipText>
      &nbsp;considerations, I concluded that <strong>the only things that <i>can</i> truly matter, to any sentient being, lie within the flows inherent in all sentient beings</strong>. Therefore, what truly matter are not the elimination of ego, greed, anger, ignorance, or anything, for they are what doesn't truly matter, not something truly matters. I am now free from dogmas, beliefs, religions (including Buddhism), etc. I shall devote my life to create works upon what truly matters for the benefits of beings.
    </p>

    <p>
      With this realization, I regard the flows inside me (e.g., my bodily needs) as “matter” so I satisfy them. In the case of conflict (of flows inside two or more sentient beings) such as eating that I only have two choices: commit suicide or harm some beings to continue living, wihout any bias, I cannot come to the definitive conclusion. I shall leave two possibilities open and make a decision only if I must. The fact that I am writing this sentence showed that I decided to continue living.

        While it can take forever to uncover the <i>actual</i> flows inside all sentient beings, I now know reasons behind many of my actions. For example, I should turn on a fan when my body needs it, and one sign for this is sweat.

      &nbsp;than ever before. Since I've got a satisfactory answer about what truly matters, it is now reasonable to find job to sustain myself that allow me to continue my endeavors.
