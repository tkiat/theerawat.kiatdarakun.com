    <h2>The True Meaning</h2>

    <div>The passage of time forced me to either commit suicide or live (and optionally decide how to live), and my subjective self inspired me to live by true meaning. Based on the definitions of&nbsp;

        Meaning is a sense of importance, which requires a <i>conscious</i> inclination toward or against something. It seems only emotions, sensory experiences, and thoughts can create meaning.

      <TooltipText text="meaning of life">
        Meaning of life is a sense of importance associated with life, which may be perceived by any capable entity (this can be that life itself or one or more other entities). The definitions of life and other entities depend on knowledge and beliefs: some believe in souls; some believe in God; some believe only in their ideas of the physical world; some believe that only their consciousness exists.

        <div>Imagine I create a unique blue unicorn named Bob. Even though Bob is fictional, its true color is blue. Painting it using a different color other than blue makes that a quality of it, but that quality is not true. The same applies to the true meaning of life. It is the meaning associated with the essence of life itself, no matter if life is fictional or not.</div>

        <br />

        <div>Things that can create meaning, namely emotions, sensory experiences, and thoughts, are parts of life; however, thoughts alone are very short-lived and thus they cannot associate with the essence of life at a later stage. For this reason, living by true meaning is to follow emotions and sensory experiences but not thoughts (or emotions created by thoughts) alone.</div>

    <h3 className="highlight">The True Meaning of Life</h3>

    <div>
      This work has three main goals: determine the abstract definition of the true meaning of life, explore concretely some ways of life that align with true meaning and compare them with existing literature, and provide some records of my life that serve as a practical example of the pursuit of the true meaning.&nbsp;

    <p>Such society conforms to the true meaning of life (from the earlier work) that may vary among its members. This work has three main goals: examine the qualities of such society, determine how it abstractly satisfies its members, and then determine how it concretely tackles common issues such as media, consumables, human rights, etc.</p>
