    <h2>The True Meaning</h2>

    <p>The passage of time forced me to either commit suicide or live (and optionally decide how to live), and my subjective self inspired me to live by true meaning. I wish to produce works about the true meaning on both individual and societal scales. These works are still in progress.</p>

      The definitions of&nbsp;

        One can be at least certain that anything made up out of thin air by oneself is not truth. Therefore, the broadest definition of truth, for a person, is every fact or belief except those made up out of thin air by that person. In this regard, one may consider the existence or the absence of God as truth (since one doesn't make either fact true by oneself), but one may not consider an object in one's imagination as truth.

        Only subjective consciousness may have meaning (i.e., a sense of importance) <i>on its own</i> as the universe without such cannot have any meaning. Therefore, in the broadest sense, subjective consciousness, together with things that can support or oppose it, may have meaning.

        One may think of true meaning as meaning bounded by truths. In the broadest sense, only subjective consciousness that can arise on its own (i.e., not made up out of thin air), together with things that can support or oppose it, may have true meaning. It includes hunger pains and instinctual feelings but not imaginary objects and attachment to sensory pleasures.

      &nbsp;of true meaning seems manageable. In this work, after describing true meaning in the broadest sense, I will explore the possible interpretations of the true meaning of life (which constitutes only true meaning) and then compare them with existing thoughts. Additionally, I will provide a record (of, e.g., the underlying reasons for consumables and belongings of my choice) that serves as a practical example of the pursuit of true meaning.

    <h3 className="highlight">Society That Truly Serves Member</h3>

    <p>A fully functional society conforms to the true meaning of life (from the earlier work) that may vary among its members. In this work, I will examine the qualities of such society and how it abstractly satisfies its members. Next, I will describe concretely how that society tackles common issues such as media, food &amp; drinks, human rights, etc.</p>
