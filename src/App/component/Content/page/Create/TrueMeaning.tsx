    <h2>The True Meaning</h2>

    <p>The passage of time forced me to either commit suicide or live (and optionally decide how to live), and my subjective self inspired me to live by true meaning. Followed by the broadest definitions of&nbsp;

        Only subjective consciousness may have meaning (i.e., a sense of importance) <i>on its own</i> as the universe without such cannot have any meaning. Therefore, in the broadest sense, subjective consciousness, together with things that can support or oppose it, may have meaning.

        <div>True meaning is meaning bounded by truths. In the broadest sense, subjective consciousness that reflects truths, together with things that can support or oppose it, may have true meaning. While one may not be certain of every truth (other than one's conscious experience), one can be at least certain that mistaking something as something else is false, e.g., sensory perception plus thought as another sensory perception, imagination as a physical quality, and memory as feeling.</div>

    <h3 className="highlight">The True Meaning of Life</h3>

    <div>
      The true meaning of life constitutes (one's judgments and interpretations of) true meaning. This work has three main goals: explore some ways of life that align with true meaning, compare them with existing literature, and provide my record that serves as a practical example of the pursuit of the true meaning. &nbsp;

    <p>A fully functional society conforms to the true meaning of life (from the earlier work) that may vary among its members. This work has three main goals: examine the qualities of such society and determine how it abstractly satisfies its members and then how it concretely tackles common issues such as media, consumables, human rights, etc.</p>
