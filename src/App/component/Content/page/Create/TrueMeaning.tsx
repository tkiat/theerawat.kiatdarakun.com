    <h2>The True Meaning</h2>

    <p>The passage of time forced me to either commit suicide or live (and optionally decide how to live), and my subjective self inspired me to live by true meaning. The definitions of&nbsp;

        While one may not know every truth

        kinds of subjective consciousness are true, one can reject some of them that are certainly false, then use his/her interpretation and judgment to either find true meaning or not find it at all.

        While the truth is a complex topic for many, if not all, one can at least be certain that modified truth is false unless it yields another truth.

        Only subjective consciousness may have meaning (i.e., a sense of importance) <i>on its own</i> as the universe without such cannot have any meaning. Therefore, in the broadest sense, subjective consciousness, together with things that can support or oppose it, may have meaning.

        <div>True meaning is meaning bounded by truths; in other words, it is subjective consciousness that reflects truths. While one may not be certain of any true subjective consciousness, one can be at least certain that mistaking something as something else is false. For example, sensory perception plus thought as another sensory perception, imagination as physical quality, and memory as feeling.</div>

        <div>Rejecting all such illusions get him/her closer to true meaning, and applying truths (in one's knowledge and beliefs) after that get him/her closest to true meaning. In the broadest sense, only non-illusory subjective consciousness, together with things that can support or oppose it, may have true meaning.</div>

    <h3 className="highlight">The True Meaning of Life</h3>

    <div>
      The true meaning of life constitutes (one's judgments and interpretations of) true meaning. This work has three main goals: explore some ways of life that align with true meaning, compare them with existing literature, and provide my record that serves as a practical example of the pursuit of the true meaning. &nbsp;

    <p>A fully functional society conforms to the true meaning of life (from the earlier work) that may vary among its members. This work has three main goals: examine the qualities of such society and determine how it abstractly satisfies its members and then how it concretely tackles common issues such as media, consumables, human rights, etc.</p>
