    <h2>The True Meaning</h2>

    <p>The passage of time forced me to either commit suicide or live (and optionally decide how to live), and my subjective self inspired me to live by true meaning. The definitions of&nbsp;

        While the truth is a complex topic for many, if not all, one can at least be certain that modified truth is false unless it yields another truth.

        Only subjective consciousness may have meaning (i.e., a sense of importance) <i>on its own</i> as the universe without such cannot have any meaning. Therefore, in the broadest sense, subjective consciousness, together with things that can support or oppose it, may have meaning.

However, subjectively modified thoughts can yield another thought.

        <div>One who does not know the absolute truths cannot certainly consider any subjective consciousness as truth. Therefore, in the broadest and most general sense, only non-modified subjective consciousness and modified thoughts, together with things that can support or oppose it, may have true meaning.</div>

    <h3 className="highlight">The True Meaning of Life</h3>

    <div>
      The true meaning of life constitutes (one's judgments and interpretations of) true meaning. This work has three main goals: explore some ways of life that align with true meaning, compare them with existing literature, and provide my record that serves as a practical example of the pursuit of the true meaning. &nbsp;

    <p>A fully functional society conforms to the true meaning of life (from the earlier work) that may vary among its members. This work has three main goals: examine the qualities of such society and determine how it abstractly satisfies its members and then how it concretely tackles common issues such as media, consumables, human rights, etc.</p>
