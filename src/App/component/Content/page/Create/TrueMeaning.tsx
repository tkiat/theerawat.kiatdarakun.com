    <h2>The True Meaning</h2>

    <p>The passage of time forced me to either commit suicide or live (and optionally decide how to live), and my subjective self inspired me to live by true meaning. I wish to produce works about the true meaning on both individual and societal scales. These works are still in progress.</p>

    <h3 className="highlight">The True Meaning of Life</h3>

    <div>
      True meaning requires truths and meaning, which are in the eye of the beholder. Stumbling upon the vagueness of the terms, I started my abstract, contemplative journey to find a more specific explanation. This journey culminated in the realization that I don't know any absolute truth but I am certain of some illusions. Therefore, instead of the path of absolute truths, I can live the least illusory path, which minimizes the only illusions I know, i.e., made-up things. This path requires the narrowest definitions of&nbsp;
      <TooltipText text="truths">
        Truths are everything that is not made up, and people may have different opinions about them. A theist who has Christian faith may regard the bible as a source of truth, while some atheists may regard it as made-up texts, hence not a source of truth. Common sources of truth that many people hold include sensory perception and widely-accepted scientific research.

      <TooltipText text="meaning">
        <p>Only subjective consciousness may have meaning (i.e., a sense of importance) because it is the only prerequisite for any entity to consider anything of importance. Meaning in anything (like iPhone, love, and cats) is only due to subjective consciousness in relation to that entity, not that entity itself.</p>

        <p>Being bounded by truths, meaning has to arise on its own (since it cannot be made up). In other words, only subjective consciousness that can arise on its own may have meaning. Pain from hunger (that arises from existing bodily functions) and a mother's instinctual compassion for her kids <i>may</i> have meaning. However, pleasure from eating (it is natural but the action is deliberate) and pain from deliberate self-harm <i>cannot</i> have meaning.</p>

    <p>In this work, I will first describe truths and meaning in abstract ways. Then, I will do the same in concrete ways. Next, I will extend truths and meaning, followed by my judgments about these extensions. Finally, I will examine the possibilities of the true meaning of life and compare them with existing literature. Additionally, I will provide a record of my choices (e.g., consumables and belongings) and the underlying reasons for them. It is a practical example of life with constant pursuits of true meaning.</p>

    <h3 className="highlight">Society That Truly Serves Member</h3>

    <p>A fully functional society conforms to the true meaning of life (from the earlier work) that may vary among its members. In this work, I will examine the qualities of such society and how it abstractly satisfies its members. Next, I will describe concretely how that society tackles common issues such as media, food &amp; drinks, human rights, etc.</p>
