        People may have different (and unproven) opinions about truths; however, one can be at least certain that anything made up out of thin air by oneself is not true. Therefore, the broadest definition of truth, for a person, is every fact or belief except those made up out of thin air by that person. In this regard, one may consider the existence or the absence of God as truth (since one doesn't make either fact true by oneself), but one may not consider an object in one's imagination as truth.

        Only subjective consciousness may have meaning (i.e., a sense of importance) <i>on its own</i> as the universe without such cannot have any meaning. Therefore, in the broadest sense, subjective consciousness, together with things that can support or oppose it, may have meaning.

        One may think of true meaning as meaning bounded by truths. In the broadest sense, only subjective consciousness that is not made up out of thin air, together with things that can support or oppose it, may have true meaning. Such subjective consciousness includes hunger pains and instinctual feelings but not imaginary objects and attachment to sensory pleasures.

    <h3 className="highlight">The True Meaning of Life</h3>

    <div>
      The true meaning of life constitutes (one's judgments and interpretations of) true meaning. This work has three main goals: explore some ways of life that align with true meaning, compare them with existing literature, and provide my record that serves as a practical example of the pursuit of the true meaning. &nbsp;

    <p>A fully functional society conforms to the true meaning of life (from the earlier work) that may vary among its members. This work has three main goals: examine the qualities of such society and determine how it abstractly satisfies its members and then how it concretely tackles common issues such as media, consumables, human rights, etc.</p>
