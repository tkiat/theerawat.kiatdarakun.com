    <h2>The True Meaning</h2>

    <p>The passage of time forced me to either commit suicide or live and decide how to live, and my subjective self inspired me to live by true meaning. I wish to produce works about the true meaning in both individual and societal scales. These works are still in progress.</p>

    <h3 className="highlight">The True Meaning of Life</h3>

    <div>True meaning requires truths and meaning, and both of them are in the eye of the beholder. Stumbling upon the vagueness of the terms, I started my abstract, contemplative journey to find the more specific explanation. This culminated in the realization that one may not know any absolute truth; however, one can instead live the least illusory path where he/she minimizes certainly illusory things, i.e., made-up things without any basis. This path requires these&nbsp;
      <TooltipText text="definitions">
        <ul>
          <li><b className="highlight">Truths</b>. Truths are everything that is not made up. A theist who has Christian faith may regard the bible as a source of truth, while some atheists may regard it as made-up texts, hence not a source of truth. Common sources of truth that many people hold include sensory perception and widely-accepted scientific research.</li>
          <li><b className="highlight">Meaning (i.e., importance)</b>. Important things are everything that is neither made up nor without any basis, and only subjective consciousness that can arise on its own can satisfy these criteria.</li>
        </ul>
      </TooltipText> of truths and meaning.
    </div>

    <p>In this work, I will firstly describe abstractly truths and meaning, then I will do the same but in an concrete way. Then, I will extend truths and meaning. Next, I will make judgments on extended truths and meaning. When the extensions seem to reach the limit, I will examine the possibilities of what can be the true meaning of life and also compare them with existing literature.</p>
    <p>Additionally, I will provide a record of my life that serves as one practical example of life with constant, authentic pursuits of true meaning. This record contains my choices (e.g., consumables, belongings, and routines) and the underlying reason for them.</p>

    <h3 className="highlight">Society That Truly Serves Member</h3>

    <p>A fully functional society conforms to the true meaning of life (from the earlier work) that may vary among its members. In this work, I will examine the qualities of such society and how it tackles common issues such as media, food &amp; drinks, human rights, etc.</p>
