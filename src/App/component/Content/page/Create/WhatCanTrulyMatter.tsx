    <h2>What Can Truly Matter</h2>

    <p>My contemplative journey to find the meaning of life has culminated in the realization that regardless of the actual reality (be it only mental construct, only material objects, both, or none), what can truly matter cannot go beyond the flow inside sentient beings. Next, I will find truths about such flows and determine the skillful ways to apply these truths in my life, others' lives, and society. This should enable readers to focus on what can truly matter instead of some illusory pursuits.</p>

    <p>Even if these works don't attract many readers, I am going to finish them anyway since nothing else truly matters. To sum up, I am doing the following works.</p>

    <ul className="more-gap-list">
      <li>
        <p><b className="highlight">Discover the meaning of life from what can truly matter</b>. There are many perspectives about the meaning of life, but all of them seem baseless. To escape from this pitfall is to begin with what can truly matter and determine the meaning of life from there. This work investigates the abstract ideas of what can truly matter.</p>

        <p>However, the abtract ideas are useless without truths. My perception is limited, and I don't know all such truths. To make my work applicable to most readers, I have to follow their ideas of truths, two scopes of which will be selected.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p><b className="highlight">Direct senses and widely accepted scientific research</b>. Direct senses are six senses (taste, smell, vision, hearing, touch, and proprioception). I also add widely accepted scientific research as truths as direct senses alone don't seem enough to many. When both truths conflict, I let science win because I believe it sympathizes with most people's ideas of truths.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p><b className="highlight">Direct senses, widely accepted scientific research, and religious beliefs</b>. It probably takes too much time for me to study all of them so I will begin with Buddhism first. When these truths conflict, I will give the following priorities: religious beliefs &gt; science &gt; direct senses because I believe that is what most people who hold such beliefs do.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>The truths about that can truly matters can be extended by pure transformations, namely memory, denotations, and logic. I will explore this in detail. Lastly, I am going to extend the scope to the societal level. The <i>ideal</i> society satisfies what can truly matter and mediate conflicts (of what can truly matter).</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p><b className="highlight">The exemplary record of my life</b>. I decided to live by what can truly matter based on my idea of truths (which contains direct senses and widely accepted scientific research). I have recorded my consumables, my belongings, my routines, etc., and I will explain the underlying reasons behind each choice.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>These works are still in progress.</p>
