    <h2>What Can Truly Matter</h2>

    <p>My abstract, contemplative journey to find the true meaning of life has culminated in the realization that any meaning is made up unless it is derived from what can truly matter, which cannot go beyond the flows inherent to sentient beings regardless of the actual nature of reality. I aspire true meaning, and I am going to finish the following works to enable the readers to focus on what can truly matter instead of illusory pursuits.</p>

        <p>The most fundamental question about meaning (of life or whatever) is not about truths but it is “what can matter?”, for we should stop asking if nothing can matter. The question becomes “What can truly matter” out of my subjective wish to search for truths, which will become the basis of my subsequent works. In this work, I will begin with the empty universe where nothing can matter and gradually adds lives into the picture to find the abstract description of what can truly matter.</p>

      Can Lead to <b className="highlight">True Meaning of Life</b>&nbsp;
      <TooltipFa faclass="fa-solid fa-circle-info">
        <p>This work is built on top of the previous work, namely the abstract description of what can truly matter. However, every abstract thing is useless without truths. My capabilities are limited, and I don't know every truth. To make my work applicable to most readers, I have to follow their common sources of truths, i.e., direct senses, widely accepted scientific research, religious beliefs.</p>

        <p>The truths about what can truly matter can then be extended by pure transformations, namely memory, denotations, and logic. I will use the extended truths, along with the judgment about them, in an attempt to find the meaning of life.</p>

        <p>Finally, I will proide the record of my choices (e.g., consumables, belongings, routines) and the underlying reason for them, which is the result of my judgments and interpretations of two sources of truths of my choice (namely direct senses and widely accepted scientific research) about what can truly matter. This record will ultimately serve as one practical example of the life with constant, authentic pursuits of true meaning.</p>

      And <b className="highlight">The Society That Truly Serves Members</b>&nbsp;
      TODO
      <TooltipFa faclass="fa-solid fa-circle-info">
        <p>This can be done by examining the qualities of the society that can satisfy the truths about what can truly matter within the members of society. I will begin with the biggest possible scope of society (i.e., all sentient beings) and, if time permits, I will do some other scopes as well (e.g., Muslim society and humanity).</p>
