    <h2>What Can Truly Matter</h2>

    <p>My contemplative journey to find the meaning of life has culminated in the realization that regardless of the actual reality (be it only mental construct, only material objects, both, or none), what can truly matter cannot go beyond the flow inside sentient beings. Next, I will find truths about such flows and determine the skillful ways to apply these truths in my life, others' lives, and society. This should enable readers to focus on what can truly matter instead of some illusory pursuits.</p>

    <p>Even if these works don't attract many readers, I am going to finish them anyway since nothing else truly matters. To sum up, I am doing the following works.</p>

    <ul className="more-gap-list">
      <li>
        <p><b className="highlight">Find the meaning of life from what can truly matter</b>. There are many perspectives about the meaning of life, but all of them seem baseless. To escape from this pitfall is to begin with what can truly matter and find the meaning of life from there. First, I will determine the abstract ideas of what can truly matter.</p>

        <p>However, the abtract ideas are useless without truths. My perception is limited, and I don't know all truths. To make my work applicable to most readers, I have to follow their ideas of truths, two scopes of which will be selected (direct senses and widely accepted scientific research, with and without religious beliefs).</p>

        <p>The truths about what can truly matters can be extended by pure transformations, namely memory, denotations, and logic. I will explore this in detail. Next, I will write about the judgment about how to apply such truths in an individual's life. Finally, I will find the meaning of life from what I have done so far.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p><b className="highlight">Create my life from what can truly matter</b>. This will serve as one practical example of how to live life by what can truly matter. I will apply my idea of truths (namely direct senses and widely accepted scientific research) about what can truly matter to my life. I have recorded my consumables, my belongings, my routines, etc., and I will explain the underlying reasons behind each choice.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p><b className="highlight">Find the ideal society from what can truly matter</b>. This can be done by examining the qualities of the society that can satisfy the truths about what can truly matter within a selected scope. A possible scope can be, e.g., a muslim society, humanity, or all sentient beings on earth. I will begin with the all sentient beings and, if time permits, some other scopes as well.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>These works are still in progress.</p>

//             <p><b className="highlight">Direct senses and widely accepted scientific research</b>. Direct senses are six senses (taste, smell, vision, hearing, touch, and proprioception). I also add widely accepted scientific research as truths as direct senses alone don't seem enough to many. When both truths conflict, I let science win because I believe it sympathizes with most people's ideas of truths.</p>
//             <p><b className="highlight">Direct senses, widely accepted scientific research, and religious beliefs</b>. It probably takes too much time for me to study all of them so I will begin with Buddhism first. When these truths conflict, I will give the following priorities: religious beliefs &gt; science &gt; direct senses because I believe that is what most people who hold such beliefs do.</p>
