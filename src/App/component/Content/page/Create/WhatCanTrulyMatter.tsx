    <h2>What Can Truly Matter</h2>

    <p>My abstract, contemplative journey to find the meaning of life has culminated in the realization that all meanings are baseless unless it is derived from what can truly matter, which cannot go beyond the flows inside sentient beings regardless of the actual nature of reality. I regard the wisest ways of life as the ones derived from no more than such flows, and I am doing the following works to enable the readers to focus on what can truly matter instead of illusory pursuits.</p>

    <p><b className="highlight">What can truly matter?</b> I will begin with the empty universe where nothing matters and gradually adds lives into the picture to find the abstract description of what can truly matter, which will become the foundations of the following aspirations.</p>

    <ul className="more-gap-list">
      <li>
        <p><b className="highlight">Discover the meaning of life</b>. The abstract description of what can truly matter is useless without truths. My capabilities are limited, and I don't know every truth. To make my work applicable to most readers, I have to follow their ideas of truths, two scopes of which will be selected (direct senses and widely accepted scientific research, with and without religious beliefs).</p>

        <p>The truths about what can truly matter can then be extended by pure transformations, namely memory, denotations, and logic. I will explore this in detail. Finally, I will use such truths, along with the judgment about them, to discover the meaning of life.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p><b className="highlight">Keep a record of my life</b>. I will make judgments about all my life choices based on my ideas of truths (namely direct senses and widely accepted scientific research) about what can truly matter. The record of such choices (e.g., consumables, belongings, routines) and their underlying reasons will ultimately serve as one practical example of what it means by living by what can truly matter.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p><b className="highlight">Describe the ideal society</b>. This can be done by examining the qualities of the society that can satisfy the truths about what can truly matter within the members of society. I will begin with the biggest possible scope of society (i.e., all sentient beings) and, if time permits, I will do some other scopes as well (e.g., Muslim society and humanity).</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>These works are still in progress.</p>
