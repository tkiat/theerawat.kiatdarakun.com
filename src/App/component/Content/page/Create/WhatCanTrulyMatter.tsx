    <h2>What Can Truly Matter</h2>

    <p>My abstract, contemplative journey to find the true meaning of life has culminated in the realization that any meaning is made up unless it is derived from what can truly matter, which cannot go beyond the flows inherent to sentient beings regardless of the actual nature of reality. I aspire true meaning, and I am going to finish the following works to enable the readers to focus on what can truly matter instead of illusory pursuits.</p>

        <p>The most basic entities that constitute any meaning (of life or whatever) are things that can matter, and therefore we need to seek them first before finding any meaning. Out of my subjective wish to search for truths, what I seek becomes “what can truly matter”, which will become the basis of my subsequent works. In this work, I will begin with the empty universe where nothing can matter and gradually adds lives into the picture to find the abstract description of what can truly matter.</p>

      Can Lead to <b className="highlight">True Meaning of Life</b>&nbsp;
      <TooltipFa faclass="fa-solid fa-circle-info">
        <p>The previous work, namely the abstract description of what can truly matter, is useless without concrete truths. My capabilities are limited, and I don't know every truth. To make my work applicable to most readers, I have to follow their common sources of truths, i.e., some of direct senses, widely accepted scientific research, and religious beliefs.</p>

        <p>The concrete truths about what can truly matter can then be extended by pure transformations, namely memory, denotations, and logic. I will use these extended truths, along with the judgment about them, in an attempt to find the meaning of life.</p>

        <p>Finally, I will provide the record of my choices (e.g., consumables, belongings, routines) and the underlying reason for them, which is the result of my judgments and interpretations of two sources of concrete truths of my choice (namely direct senses and widely accepted scientific research) about what can truly matter. This record will ultimately serve as one practical example of the life with constant, authentic pursuits of true meaning.</p>

      And <b className="highlight">The Society That Truly Serves Members</b>&nbsp;
      <TooltipFa faclass="fa-solid fa-circle-info">
        <p>Such society satisfies the truths about what can truly matter within its members. I will examine the qualities of such society, beginning from one possible scope of society (i.e., all human beings). Then, I will examine how such society tackles common issues such as media, food &amp; drinks, techonology, human rights, etc. If time permits, I will do some other scopes as well (e.g., Muslim society and Thai people).</p>
