    <h2>What Can Truly Matter</h2>

    <p>My abstract, contemplative journey to find the true meaning of life has culminated in the realization that any meaning is made up unless it is derived from what can truly matter, which cannot go beyond the flows inherent to sentient beings regardless of the actual nature of reality. I aspire true meaning, and therefore I am going to finish (and live by) the following works instead of illusory pursuits.</p>

    <div>
      Only <b className="highlight">Concrete Truths About What Can Truly Matter</b>&nbsp;
      <TooltipFa faclass="fa-solid fa-circle-info">
        <p>In this work, I make arguments for what should be considered as the abstract description of what can truly matter. However, it is useless without concrete truths. My capabilities are limited, and I don't know every truth. Therefore, I will follow some common sources of truths, e.g., six senses, scientific research, and religious beliefs. These truths, along with pure transformations (namely denotation, memory, and logic), will become the basis of my subsequent works.</p>

    <div>
      Can Lead to <b className="highlight">True Meaning of Life</b>&nbsp;
      <TooltipFa faclass="fa-solid fa-circle-info">
        <p>I will make judgment on truths about what can truly matter from the earlier work. When I cannot extend such truths anymore, it is then time to examine the possibilities of what can be true meaning of life. I will also compare them with existing literature.</p>

        <p>Additionally, I will provide the record of my life that serves as one practical example of the life with constant, authentic pursuits of true meaning. This record contains my choices (e.g., consumables, belongings, routines) and the underlying reason for them, which is the result of my judgments and interpretations of my ideas of concrete truths about what can truly matter.</p>
      </TooltipFa>
    </div>

    <div>
      And <b className="highlight">Society That Truly Serves Members</b>&nbsp;
      <TooltipFa faclass="fa-solid fa-circle-info">
        <p>Such society conforms to the concrete truths about what can truly matter within its members. I will examine the qualities of such society and how it tackles common issues such as media, food &amp; drinks, human rights, etc.</p>
      </TooltipFa>
    </div>

    <p>These works are still in progress.</p>
