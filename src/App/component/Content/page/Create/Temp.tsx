    <h2>The True Meaning</h2>

    <div>The passage of time forced me to either commit suicide or live (and optionally decide how to live), and my subjective self inspired me to live by true meaning. Based on the definitions of&nbsp;

        Meaning is a sense of importance, which requires a <i>conscious</i> inclination toward or against something. To my knowledge, only instinctual emotions, sensory perceptions, and thoughts can create meaning.

      <TooltipText text="the meaning of life">
        The meaning of life is a sense of importance that emerges from life, and any capable entity may perceive it. The definition of such an entity depends on knowledge and beliefs. Some believe in souls and/or God; some believe only in their ideas of the physical world; some believe that only their consciousness exists.

        <div>Having five legs is a true property of a five-leg unicorn, even though it is fictional. Likewise, the true meaning of life is a sense of importance emerging from the inherent properties of life (whether or not life is fictional), and any capable entity may perceive it.</div>

        <div>To my knowledge, only instinctual emotions, sensory experiences, and thoughts can create meaning, out of which only the first two are the inherent qualities of life since thoughts alone are arbitrary. Based on emotions and sensory perceptions, one may use memories and thoughts to align actions and possessions with meanings emerging from them. Such action, though probably imperfect, is always a manifestation of one's pursuit of true meaning.</div>

    <h3 className="highlight">The True Meaning of Life</h3>

    <div>
      This work has four main goals: to determine the abstract definition of the true meaning of life, explore concretely a few different pursuits of true meaning, examine existing literature through the lens of true meaning, and provide some records that reflect my pursuit of true meaning.&nbsp;

    <p>Such society conforms to the true meaning of life (from the earlier work) that may vary among its members. This work has three main goals: examine the qualities of such society, determine how it abstractly satisfies its members, and then determine how it concretely tackles common issues such as media, consumables, human rights, etc.</p>
