      <dt><b className="highlight">Low-Impact Living</b></dt>
      <dd>My ideal life based on what truly matter is free of greediness, and thus I value minimalism, sustainability, and low-impact living. It is a lot of fun and creativity boosting to find a way to make my items (like table, lamp, detergents, food, etc.) less impactful to myself, other beings, and the earth. Oftentimes I need to make a judgment about how much I trade my time and convenience for it.</dd>

      <dt><b className="highlight">Increase Awareness</b></dt>
      <dd>I like to consume information to increase my awareness of the world. This should help reinforce my understanding of what truly matter. It can be news, documentaries, discoveries, inventions, opinions, etc.</dd>

      <dt><b className="highlight">Writing</b></dt>
      <dd>Life is too short to die alone without anything to share with others. Because the storage size of text is the lowest (as compared to another form of medium), writing seems to be the most minimalist way to convey thoughts and leave a lot of room for imagination to a reader.</dd>

      <dt><b className="highlight">(Free and) Open Source Software</b></dt>
      <dd>Software enables me to create and share my thoughts to the whole world in any creative form that text alone cannot convey. I advocate free and open source software (FOSS) for all software lower than application software since they cannot be easily replaced by a user once installed. For local, application software, I advocate at least open source software and the availability of FOSS alternatives for all non-entertainment software (like content creation)</dd>

      <dt><b className="highlight">Philosophy</b></dt>
      <dd>Knowledge of philosophy should make my works (on what can truly matter) more accessible and acceptable to the general public. I have yet to read a lot of works but I will definitely do so in free time.</dd>
