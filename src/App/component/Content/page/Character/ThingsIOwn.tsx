              <p><b className="highlight">Dried Food</b> — The ideal containers for typical dried food is airtight, opaque, and they should be place in a cool enough place without moisture. However, I have my own preference to see through items in a container to minimize confusion, and this gives me two main choices: glasses and food-grade plastic.</p>

              <p>While both are safe for cool, dried food, I prefer glass anyway since it is recyclable, nonporous, and easy to clean. Since it is easily breakable, I usually bring a cooking utensil near it and make a transfer, not the other way around. I am thinking of buying a cover for them to protect food therein from the penetrative light.</p>

                I love herbs, legumes, and grains, and I need airtight containers for them to prevent ants. I need them at different sizes because I sometimes buy food in bulk. I finally chose a glassware from China (Chuangfeng Glass) that is available in many sizes. The handle is more firm than expected and the two-layer lid makes it airtight. I have seen this one often in a random video on Youtube Shorts when it took place in China.

                I find it convenient to have a continer with wide lid to store baking soda (that I use to wash veggies) and probably sugar (although I almost never use it). Because those consumables often come with 0.5 - 1kg in size, a glass jar like this is suitable.

                I sometimes get dried food in small amount (like 200g). A small glass container like this is not only suitable for this purpose but also stackable!

                Unlike its bigger brother, I usually put it in the fridge. Its small size makes it ideal to store grounded seeds and powder that spoil fast, while its stackability utilizes space.

                I eat a few bananas daily, and I need to keep it in the fridge to prolong its life. I can use a plastic bag and some other methods but a rectangular container enables me to conveniently stack another container on top of it. That's why I chose this spaceful plastic container (from Super Lock). It's usuaully big enough to store a bunch of bananas. On some occasions, I also bring this container outside to get beansprouts without a plastic bag.

                It's an airtight borosilicate glassware from Double Lock. I choose it as the lid comes with a thick silicone and it's of good quality. I usally store boiled vegetables in this container and keep it in the fridge.

                I need drink containers made of glass to safely store plain water, soy milk, and herbal drinks for use at home. I ended up with this glass of an unknown brand but any common glass should be food safe. Its shape acts like an anti-slip handle itself, and this should reduce the risk of accidents. The lid is plastic from an unknown brand so I usually set it upright. It's still better to find food-grade replacement and replace it once every 1-2 years or so.

                I needed to find non-glass container for outdoor use, and I finally bought these plastic bottles (Double Lock 33140) that allows a tight grip. Yeah, I know a stainless steel or aluminium bottle is usually considered healthier and more sustainable overall but I already have these bottles. I might replace them in the future.

                While I can cook rice in a stainless steel pot, it sticks a lot at bottom so I needlessly have to throw it away. Furthermore, it's a waste of time to stay vigilant all the time and rice is staple for my diet. That's why I need a non-stick, automatic rice cooker. This one is from Panasonic (SR-JQ105) with an optional plastic layer for steaming on top. I don't usualy use that since I usually cook the rice full of it and then store it in the fridge.

              <FigureOptionalTooltip src="/character/belongings/pot-4.5L.png" label="4.5L" width="125px">
                I almost always cook myself so a pot is essential. Such pot should be designed for induction cooking as well since I can use induction cooker (which is more energy efficient than the electrical couterpart) when the gas is depleted. The ideal size should be around 4-5 litres since it is enough to cook once and reasonably fuel me (for half a week). After some research, I ended up with a stainless steel pot from Zebra head (Extra Infinity Plus with 22cm lid).

              <FigureOptionalTooltip src="/character/belongings/pan.png" width="110px">
                In addition to a pot, a pan is also essential (e.g., for frying). As with a pot, I wanted it to be compatible to an induction stove. I ended up with a stainless steel pan from Zebra head (IH vitalux with 24cm width).

                I don't really need a smoothie blender but I got this one from my mother. While it is true that whole fruits are generally better, a blender is ideal for protein powder. That's why I usually mix some fruits with grounded flaxseed and sesame seeds and vegan protein powder with soy milk I made myself in the morning. By the way, this one is from Gokusen (GTS-300).

I chose this ceramic cup (an ordinary one from Tesco Lotus). It's still in a OK condition after five years of daily use but the outer color at the lip is slightly faded. I hope that doesn't contain lead. I think it's time to find a new one.
