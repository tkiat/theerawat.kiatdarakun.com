    Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!&nbsp;
    <MyTooltipImgWithDelay src="/book.svg">
      <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/"><b>Link</b></a> — I mostly completed this book. I was pretty much lost in the later half at first. Having written a featureful pomodoro application in Haskell, I later reread it and finally understood it.

      <a href="https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book"><b>Link</b></a> — I completed probably half of the book, and I will probably forget most of them. I have used the module pattern extensively in my personal website and perhaps in the future projects as well. I might reread it later.

    , CIS194: Introduction to Haskell&nbsp;
    <MyTooltipImgWithDelay src="/course.svg">
      <a href="https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis1940/spring13/lectures.html"><b>Link</b></a> — I read Learn You a Haskell book before but I couldn't quite get much of it. I then stumbled across the best free introduction Haskell course according to <a href="https://github.com/bitemyapp/learnhaskell">bitemyapp</a> so I took it. The instructor explains not very in details, which I found it sufficient. I gained much more understandings especially Monad. However, I didn't do any exercise since that seemed to take much time. You may request the solution from this <a href="https://github.com/byorgey/haskell-course">GitHub</a> link.

    Cloud Computing Basics&nbsp;
    <MyTooltipImgWithDelay src="/course.svg">
      <a href="https://coursera.org/share/7fa417bc8244a27c8ccb08295906fb99"><b>Coursera</b></a> — I took this short for fun as it offered a free certificate. It is a guide to cloud computing with a brief explanation of related technologies. This is a very short course (probably &lt; 3 hours with some preknowledge). The instructor at times reads what is shown on slides and not explains everything that appears on them so I personally don't recommend this course. You are better off reading Wikipedia in my opinion.

      I became aware that the web knowledge offers me significant freedom so I took some 5 web-related courses here. The courses are about basics HTML/CSS/JS, fornt-end/back-end coding, React.js, and a few other libraries. I deleted my account there so the certificate links are gone.

    , React - The Complete Guide&nbsp;
    <MyTooltipImgWithDelay src="/course.svg">
      <b><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/">Udemy</a></b> — A popular course about React.js for beginners. I paid and enrolled in this course as I wanted to build some websites (including my personal website). The basic contents are laid out nicely but the instructor didn't cover all advanced stuff. At the end he did a project that I followed along but I knew unless I did the project from scratch myself I wouldn't be familiar with the language.

    Algorithms&nbsp;
    <MyTooltipImgWithDelay src="/course.svg">
      <a href="https://coursera.org/verify/specialization/LP2AXJ7TUNRV"><b>Coursera</b></a> — I was unexplainably drawn to computer science just a month after coming back from Germany, and algorithms seemed like the most important basics so I took it. I paid 49 USD for the certificate and finished within a month. This coursera specialization contains 4 algorithm-related courses focusing deeply on theory. I would recommend this course for an aspiring computer scientist, but I was not that drawn much to the theoretical side so I skipped some lectures. I am not impressed with the assignment format since anyone can just put a correct number to pass the assignment.

    , Data Structures and Algorithms&nbsp;
    <MyTooltipImgWithDelay src="/course.svg">
      <p><a href="https://coursera.org/verify/specialization/MHRFWABPYTJU"><b>Coursera</b></a> — I was addicted to the previous algorithm specialization so I took this speciailization also. It contains 6 courses, and the hidden corner cases for the assignments alone made this course already worth it. I paid 49 USD for the certificate and finished within a month. This specialization is, to me, very challenging, especially some tasks in the capstone project. Therefore, I think non full-time learners might take longer than a month.</p>

      <p>This course covered the data structure and algorithms from the basics to more advanced topics. The genome-related courses provide me the insight into how the algorithm can help improve real-life applications. I was impressed by the coding assignments as there are a lot of them and there were a variety of programming languages to choose from. The runtime limit for each submission depends on the programming languages where C++ appeared to be less forgiving.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, there were a lot of hidden cases (inputs and expected outputs) for each assignment so one cannot simply cheat easily. It was sometimes hard to overcome corner cases, but there was a healthy amount of hint from the discussion forum. Code copy/paste activity was strongly discouraged, of course, but pseudocodes were available. I would recommend this course to anyone.</p>
