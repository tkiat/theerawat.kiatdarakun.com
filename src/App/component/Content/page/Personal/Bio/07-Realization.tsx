        Sure, my awareness tells me to change my position when I ache, but what about eating? I currently need to harm other sentient beings for food (even vegan food due to insects), which is a conflict since my awareness tells me that all beings want to survive (as, e.g., their bodies heals themselves). Should I commit suicide or continue living?

      &nbsp;using only awareness. I then examined everything from scratch. Most fundamentally, one has to subjectively decide to either live or commit suicide, and one who lives may subjectively decide how to live. After a long self-introspection, I realized that my survival instincts nudged me to live and I had a strong passion to live by true meaning.

        Meaning is a sense of importance, which requires a <i>conscious</i> inclination toward or against something. To my knowledge, only instinctual emotions, sensory perceptions, and thoughts can create meaning.

        The meaning of life is a sense of importance that emerges from life, and any capable entity may perceive it. The definition of such an entity depends on knowledge and beliefs. Some believe in souls and/or God; some believe only in their ideas of the physical world; some believe that only their consciousness exists.

        Having five legs is a true property of a five-leg unicorn, even though it is fictional. Likewise, the true meaning of life is a sense of importance emerging from the inherent properties of life (whether or not life is fictional), and any capable entity may perceive it.

        To my knowledge, only instinctual emotions, sensory experiences, and thoughts can create meaning, out of which only the first two are the inherent qualities of life since thoughts alone are arbitrary. Based on emotions and sensory perceptions, one may use memories and thoughts to align actions and possessions with meanings emerging from them. Such action, though probably imperfect, is always a manifestation of one's pursuit of true meaning.
