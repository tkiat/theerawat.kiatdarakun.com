        Sure, my awareness tells me to change my position when I ache, but what about eating? I currently need to harm other sentient beings for food (even vegan food due to insects), which is a conflict since my awareness tells me that all beings want to survive. Should I starve to death or continue living?

      . I then examined everything from scratch, then I finally discovered the most fundamental conceptual unit behind every conscious action, namely "meaning" (i.e., a sense of importance) and "lack of meaning". One may perform a conscious action without any meaning (e.g., wave a hand just for the sake of it) or with some meaning (e.g., post a Youtube video in the hope of becoming famous).</p>

    <p>However, as wisdom is the ability to make a good judgment, it has to be based on things that are evidential rather than illusory. Therefore, a wise person would perform any conscious action based on true meaning, rather than false meaning or no meaning at all. Fortunately, I can perceive truth by using my awareness since it is itself truth.</p>

    <p>I can only so far be aware of my sensual experiences and thoughts, and these are my limited realization of truth. True meaning, from my perspective, is therefore either my sensual experience and thought that is important. My experience of hunger, for example, is true meaning since I actually experience it (truth) and it demands something (meaning).</p>



     <p> Following the awareness is still the only wise option (as it is evidential unlike mind). However, in the case of the conflict, one has to judge and cat accordingly. One cannot consider himself wise when he makes no judgment. After all, wisdom is about the ability to make a good judgment right?.</p>

    <p>Such judgment needs to be carried out by my mind. It is usually not possible to pinpoint the best judgment (e.g., one cannot absolutely objectively compare a human's worth with a cow's during an emergency rescue), but I often has no choice. I have discovered that the metric that enables good judgments (on a conflict) is "true meaning", i.e., .</p>

    <p>I now conclude that any seeker of wisdom should live by true meaning.</p>
