        Sure, my awareness tells me to change my position when I ache, but what about eating? I currently need to harm other sentient beings for food (even vegan food due to insects), which is a conflict since my awareness tells me that all beings want to survive. Should I starve to death or continue living?

      . I then examined everything from scratch, then I finally discovered the most fundamental conceptual unit that motivates every conscious action, namely "meaning" (i.e., a sense of importance) and "lack of meaning". One may perform a conscious action without any meaning (e.g., wave a hand just for the sake of it) or with some meaning (e.g., post something to get fame just for the sake of it).</p>

    <p>As wisdom is the ability to make a good judgment, it has to be based on things that are true rather than illusory. Therefore, a wise person would perform any conscious action based on true meaning, rather than false meaning or no meaning at all. What is truth? I can perceive truth by using my awareness since it is itself truth. Some beliefs can be considered truth by some as well since it cannot be proves false.</p>

    <p>I can only so far be aware of my sensual experiences and thoughts, and these are my limited realization of truth (I don't regard any belief as truth here for the sake of simplicity). Therefore, true meaning, from my perspective, comes from either my sensual experience and thought that is important. My hunger, for example, is true meaning since I am actually aware of it (truth) and it demands something to alleviate the pain (meaning).</p>

    <p>Tha path of true meaning often involves inevitable conflicts of true meaning, for example, my hunger is in conflict with my sympathy for <i>sentient</i> insects that die from food production. While I cannot compare my hunger with that sympathy in a totally objective manner, a seeker of wisdom has no choice but to try to resolve the conflict anyway since a man who makes no judgment when needed cannot be considered wise.</p>

    <p>I wish to live by true meaning and produce relevant works out of the strong wish to become a wise person. Now I know the conceptual basis behind all my actions and what to do in my life. I hope to totally get out of the darkness of ignorance as much as I can.</p>
