Things that interested me outside of the study are volunteer camps (a few days each), some exercises (swimming, jogging, badminton), and traveling (not that far, usually by free trains). Everything new was opened to me and I appreciated that.</p>

    <p>My life changed a lot more after I joined the university. The English curriculum broadened my horizon (in both technical knowledge and language senses). My faculty, at the time, had three choices: electronics, mechatronics, and communications. I preferred communications over the other two so I did an internship at&nbsp;
