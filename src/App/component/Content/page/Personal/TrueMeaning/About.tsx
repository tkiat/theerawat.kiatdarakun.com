    <p>A long period of self-introspection has culminated in overcoming <i>long</i> analysis paralysis on what I should do in my life. To answer that question, one has to investigate the most fundamental building blocks that motivate every conscious action, namely "meaning" (i.e., a sense of importance) and "lack of meaning". One may perform a conscious action without any meaning (e.g., waving a hand just for the sake of it) or with some meaning (e.g., posting something to gain fame).</p>

    <p>One who seeks wisdom (i.e., the ability to make good judgments) needs to base his/her conscious actions on things that are true rather than illusory. In other words, such a person would rather live by true meaning than false meaning or no meaning at all. My strong wish to become wise inspired me to philosophize on "true meaning" and also live by it myself. I split this work into two books of different scopes: individual and societal scopes.</p>

    <p>The first book focuses on true meaning as perceived by a single entity such as myself, a fellow human, and an animal. The second book describes the ideal society that enables each member to follow his/her true meaning by tackling common issues such as media, consumables, human rights, etc. The book also shows how such society resolves the conflicts, if any, for the best interests of all members.</p>

    <p>The work is in progress and everything is subject to change.</p>
