# Course: Data Structures and Algorithms (Coursera)

## Review

I was addicted to the previous algorithm specialization so I took this speciailization also. It contains 6 courses, and the hidden corner cases for the assignments alone made this course already worth it. I paid 49 USD for the certificate and finished within a month. This specialization is, to me, very challenging, especially some tasks in the capstone project. Therefore, I think non full-time learners might take longer than a month.

This course covered the data structure and algorithms from the basics to more advanced topics. The genome-related courses provide me the insight into how the algorithm can help improve real-life applications. I was impressed by the coding assignments as there are a lot of them and there were a variety of programming languages to choose from. The runtime limit for each submission depends on the programming languages where C++ appeared to be less forgiving.

Furthermore, there were a lot of hidden cases (inputs and expected outputs) for each assignment so one cannot simply cheat easily. It was sometimes hard to overcome corner cases, but there was a healthy amount of hint from the discussion forum. Code copy/paste activity was strongly discouraged, of course, but pseudocodes were available. I would recommend this course to anyone.
