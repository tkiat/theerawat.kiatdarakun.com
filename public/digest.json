    "review": "It is a book about Leo Tolstoy who was not able to find the meaning of life despite his material success. The strongest message of his book I found is that the meaning of life cannot be found rationally. I rejected his religious solution. Instead, that message made me introspect my own emotional needs and personalities to find my purpose."
