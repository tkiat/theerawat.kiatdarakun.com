    "review_short": "It is a book about Leo Tolstoy who was not able to find the meaning of life despite his material success. The strongest message of his book I found is that the meaning of life cannot be found rationally. I rejected his religious solution. Instead, that message made me introspect my own emotional needs and personalities to find my purpose."

    "review_short": "I was going to build my portfolio site and gaining more perspective about how to put myself out there sounds like a good idea. I, by chance, discovered this course and I got the certificate for free because of the coronavirus outbreak giveaway.\n\nThis course is about how to construct personal branding without any practical assignment. The instructor talks in a casual and relaxing manner. The course is worth it to me though as I haven't been aware of some of the tips before, but the length is only around 4-10 hours and not at all in-depth."
