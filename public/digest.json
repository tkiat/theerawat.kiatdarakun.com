        "review_short": "It is a book about Leo Tolstoy who was not able to find the meaning of life despite his material success. The strongest message of his book I found is that the meaning of life cannot be found rationally. I rejected his religious solution. Instead, that message made me introspect my own emotional needs and personalities to find my purpose."

I was by no means familiar with Islam and had no expertise to judge the correctness of the book, but I found that the book laid out the content nicely. It explains the basic Islamic principles and then the death penalties, and finally suggests that it is not a violation of Sharia law to adapt the death penalties in accordance with univeral human rights law."

I would recommend this course for an aspiring computer scientist, but I was not that drawn much to the theoretical side so I skipped some lectures. I am not impressed with the assignment format since anyone can just put a correct number to pass the assignment."
