# Tower of Time

I received this game on GOG as a freebie. The review says positives about this game so I gave it a shot.

## Review

The game features a man with a fate to investigate an upside-down magical tower. He, with his comrades, sets up the camp nearby and then proceeds to take a journey down there with an isometric viewpoint. All characters start off with basic weapons and skills, but, like a typical (c)RPG, a player can increase their attributes and complete more skill trees. Plenty of conversations, journals, and narrative voices along the way gradually uncover the backstories and secrets behind this mysterious tower.

The difficulty is changeable so I recommend a hard difficulty as tactical combat is a strong point of this game. It is very tactical with the ability to slow or pause time to carry out a cool strategy against a horde of enemies. Each character has different skill trees: specialization in range combats, melee combats, supportive spells, etc. You can go back from the tower to the camp from time to time to train and improve the skills of your comrades.

The game, at the beginning, got me really intrigued. Everything was so mysterious that I wanted to read and interact with every object in the tower. The excitement went downhill since the later of the 5th floor where I began to familiarize myself with the settings of the tower and kept finding roughly the same stuff, making it a little more the grind than the original thrill. In addition, the plot in the final ending did not totally make sense to me.

I completed the game on a hard difficulty except for only one mission where they **...SECRET...** such that my frustration forced me to beat that on an easier mode. Overall, the game was still worth my time and I recommend it to everybody who likes a story-rich CRPG. It is just that its lackluster second half makes it 7/10 in my book instead of 9.5/10.
