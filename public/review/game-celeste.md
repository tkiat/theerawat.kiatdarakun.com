# Celeste

## Review

Celeste is a platformer game featuring a woman who aspires to become a mountain summitter. During the journey, she meets new people and encounters her other self (representing her depression and anxiety). You control her from the bottom at the beginning to the summit which marks the end of the main story.

The game is often touted as very difficult but do not let that mislead you. Levels are divided into A, B, and C sides where A side is the main story itself (exclude chapter 8) and B sides need to be unlocked in secret areas. Unlike the main story, I find the B and C sides very difficult and unfun. After dying multiple times in one of the B-side levels I stopped playing and used cheat mode just to see how it is.

Therefore, I recommend any non-hardcore player to skip the B and C sides altogether. Is it a shame? A big no! One who seeks enjoyment should find no reason to do anything unenjoyable. Is it a shame not to tolerate a difficult-to-listen-to music album? No right? A hardcore player who seeks challenges may grind however he/she likes.

Everything in the game, in my opinion, takes a back seat to excellent music and its gorgeous pixel art. Together, they make the journey soothing and exciting. I later bought the music from Bandcamp for $10 and listened to it many times afterward. The feeling at the end that you reach the summit after the struggle is fulfilling. This game overall contains a huge feel-good vibe and I recommend this game to anybody.
