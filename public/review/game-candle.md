# Candle

I bought this on GOG for like $3 something.

## Review

Candle is a 2D puzzle-adventure game that features the story of a man whose tribe has been attacked by another greedy tribe. His quest is to rescue captured prisoners and some important shamans. To do so, He interacts with distinct objects and utilizes his ability to somehow light his hand with fire from the source. The conversation mechanic is quite unique in that the spoken words are unintelligible, but the animated drawing in dialog bubbles and subsequent narrative explains those.

The hand-drawn art and various effects are phenomenal and in my opinion the strongest point of the game. Together with soothing music and slow-paced settings, I got a very relaxing experience. Sometimes this experience is interrupted by some difficult puzzles but, to me, they are quite rare. I recommend this game to any puzzle fan who wants to appreciate great visual beauty.
