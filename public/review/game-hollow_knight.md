# Hollow Knight

I bought this game for $8.99 from GOG in 2019. The game has a lot to offer and deserves more than this price in my opinion.

## Review

Hollow Knight is a well-regarded Metroidvania game about the story of a small warrior bug who ventures through the ruins of the underneath kingdom. The conversation and writings throughout the kingdom gradually reveal the backstory behind the kingdom's current state and what to do next. The writings are top-notch but quite cryptic, to me, in showing the backstory of the kingdom because the in-game texts are not quite straightforward but Wikipedia helps.

The game is very huge and designed in a way that it is a little tedious to move from place to place. Without any walkthrough, I would have often wasted time from place to place, for the most part, because the game is often cryptic about what to do next and how to achieve certain abilities to get through some obstacles. This may be appealing for some players with explorative minds who have a lot of time to spend and chill out but this can also frustrate many players without a walkthrough at hand.

Let me warn you. There is only *one* difficulty in this game and the game is not, to me, easy. You may die from time to time; however, all enemies' attacks are patterned so after some familiarity you can beat the crap out of everything. I believe most players should be able to finish it unless you are a super casual type. The DLCs like The Grimm Troupe and Godmaster contain some challenging bosses but they are entirely optional.

All levels are handcrafted, i.e., procedurally generated, and this adds personality to the game. Art is hand-drawn and often in gloomy colors, which reflect beautifully the ruined kingdom. Background music nicely builds up the atmosphere filled with desperation and a sense of loss. The game is demanding: I would have spent around 25 hours (even with a walkthrough) to achieve the easiest ending. I ended up spending almost 50 hours beating everything except Pantheon 5 in Godmaster DLC. I recommend this game to those who fancy exploration, not the one who looks for a shorter game.
