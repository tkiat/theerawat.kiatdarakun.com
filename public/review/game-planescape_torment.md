# Planescape: Torment: Enhanced Edition

This game, along with Baldur's Gate I and II are touted as among the greatest cRPGs of all time so I bought them all from a sale on GOG.

## Review

Planescape: Torment is an isometric cRPG game based on Dungeon and Dragons rules. You do not know any of these rules in order to play this game, just embrace all the RNGs and stuff given to you. The in-game combat is, in my opinion, the weakest point of this game where the control and the pace are quite awkward. For this reason, I find the hard difficulty unfun to play. Besides, you can avoid many encounters.

The game seems to focus more on story and diplomacy where your dialog choices usually matter. It is important to note that the wisdom attribute enables more dialog and, for this reason, strength, dexterity, and constitution should be your dump stats if you long for a rich story. The script in this game is very long (around 1 million English words), which makes it comparable to some very long novels. You can think of this game as a novel with interactions.

The story takes place at a mortuary where the protagonist seems to have no memory whatsoever. The journey unravels his past and therefore leads to his decisions based on that. You will, over time, gather some companions until the end of the story. The plot and written dialogs are very impressive and therefore I very highly recommend this game to everyone, especially cRPG fans and some novel lovers who want to try some interactive experience.

Last but not least, I got both original and enhanced editions. The former offers, in my opinion, a very lackluster experience due to its low resolution. This alone (even not counting bug fixes and other quality-of-life improvements) makes the enhanced edition better.
