# MINIMALISM: Official Netflix Documentary

I perceived minimalism as a way to reduce (or minimize) excess from one's life. This sympathizes with the philosophy of true meaning in that it reduces some certain illusions; however, it does so only to a certain extent. Nevertheless, knowing minimalism should give me the opportunity to explain my philosophy from a minimalist's standpoint. I have already watched some short videos on minimalists' lives, but I came across this long video so I gave it a shot.

This documentary describes topics in the lenses of minimalism and also the background of the two main guys (of the minimalism), I mainly summarize the former here. I feel like the material can be condensed a lot because the concept is quite simple, but the number of invited guests makes it more understandable.

## Summary

Mainstream cultures (TVs, movies, books, etc.) create illusions that what our lives should be, and this leads to immense dissatisfaction of trying to live that way. Minimalism is an antidote to that. Overall, it is a concept about removing excess (or unimportant things) so that one, with more freedom, can live more purposefully. At the beginning, the documentary focuses on two founders of the minimalist.

- **Ryan Nicodemus**. Despite professional success, he has gaping void in his life so he try to fill the void with stuff (and spent more than his income). He later noticed Josh, his best friend who seemed happy, and was introduced minimalism.
- **Josh**. Before his discovery of minimalism, he had plenty of stuff in his home. He felt happier and lighter after getting rid of his excess stuff. Anything is an excess to him if it does not add value to his life. He now lives deliberately with less.

Subsequently, the film focuses on some topics.

- **Apartment**. Small space makes sense environmentally and financially. It also brings people closer.
- Fast Fashion. We should care about the inherent quality of the products themselves rather than their symbolic meanings. Fast fashion, for example, encourages us to buy clothes and sell used ones needlessly while we actually need to get ones for two or four seasons. This harms the environment. Some may buy to fill the void but it actually makes him hungry for more without fulfillment. The documentary introduces the project 333 whose a participant wears 33 items (cloths, shoes, and accessories) in three months. Courtney Carver, who worked in advertising, tried this project and found that nobody noticed her change in the first three months.
- **Money**. Money boosts well beings and happiness only until certain theshold. One may not have control over how much money he makes but he has control over how less he spends. Financial freedom, the ability to spend one's day as he/she sees fit, is more important than financial gain.
- **Smartphone**. A research shows we check our phones 150 times a day. We often consume content mindlessly. Because we can do everything we want on our smartphones, we can potentially do everything we want. This means we sacrifice some very important things in the process.
- **Meditation**. Dan Harris, who works at ABC News, uses recrational drugs to help cope with depression deafter his long trip to Iraq. It led to his panick attack on live TV so he seeked what he overlooked at first which is mediation. It helped him find well beings in present moment. There is certain amount of worry that makes sense and another that does not. When you worry 17th time about missing a flight ask yourselves if it is useful.
- **Kids**. The amount of advertisements for kids has increased and go around from their moms to the kids directly. Most of them are junk and have no social benefits. The documentary then begins to introduce Jushua Becker who is against the undercurrent of consumerism that encourages a person to become what the world wants him to be rather than his own. He sets a certain boundary for his kids but ultimately allow them to be what they want even it is not so minimalist.
