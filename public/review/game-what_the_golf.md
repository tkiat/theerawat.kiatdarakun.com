# What the Golf?

## Review

What the Golf? is a casual game about, unsurprisingly, golf. While some might find golf boring and unattractive, this game is, infact, very creative. It resembles golf only the control itself, and the rest is totally different. For example, on some levels a player controls a car in the same manner as a golfer swings his ball. That is, a player use a swing to push a car in one direction and then another swing to prevent it from falling off a cliff.

The game seems to imitate (or, in some senses, mock) the mechanics of other games such as Portal, Superhot, Angry Bird, Donut County, Guitar Hero, Flappy Bird, Mario, and maybe some more. There are also a lot of sport-theme levels here. You will swing golf through multiple types of terrains and atmosphere. Some levels are hard; a few of them are awkward to control and, to me, unfun. Nevertheless, I enjoyed most of the levels here.

A level has three sublevels. I find that the second and the third are harder than the first sublevel, but oftentimes the second is harder than the third. Each level is usually very short so this game is also suitable for killing a little time. I spend around 8 hours to beat all possible levels with all secrets. I highly recomend this game for people who want humorous experience filled with surprises and various mechanics. This game is not for a serious golfer!
