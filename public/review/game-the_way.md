# The Way

I got this game, as always, at a discounted price from GOG.

## Review

Inspired by the like of Another World, The Way is a story about a guy who, at his wife's grave, retrived the corpse into a pod and then stole a spaceship from a company to take on the journey to revive his wife. He will encounter alien civilizations where he must fight and solve a lot of puzzles. The puzzle is doable except one where I had to take a note. This is awful but the rest is enjoyable.

The atmosphere is excellent. The retro piexelart that depicts ancient civilizations and strange creatures inspire a sense of uneasiness and eeriness and, at times, even scariness. The game has built up the mixed emotions of hope and desperation until the end, culminating in my most favourite ending of all time. In my opinion, this is a very underrated game. I would recommend this game to anyone who wants an excellent ending and never mind to solve some puzzles.
