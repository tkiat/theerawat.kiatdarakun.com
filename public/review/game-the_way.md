# The Way

I got this game, as always, at a discounted price from GOG.

## Review

Inspired by the likes of Another World, The Way is a story about a guy who, at his wife's grave, retrieved the corpse into a pod and then stole a spaceship from a company to take on the journey to revive his wife. He will encounter alien civilizations where he must fight and solve a lot of puzzles. The puzzle is doable except for one where I had to take a note. This sounds awful but the rest of the puzzles is enjoyable.

The atmosphere is excellent. The retro pixel art that depicts ancient civilizations and strange creatures inspires a sense of uneasiness and eeriness and, at times, even scariness. The game has built up a mixture of hope and desperation until the end, culminating in my favorite ending. In my opinion, this is a very underrated game. I would recommend this game to anyone who wants excellent endings and finds it enjoyable to solve some puzzles.
