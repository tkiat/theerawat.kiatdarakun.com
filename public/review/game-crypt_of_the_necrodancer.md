# Crypt of the NecroDancer

It's the first PC game that I played after two years of inactivity. The thing is I was on QubesOS and I would like to try some games but my onboard Thinkpad X260 GPU I didn't have too many options. This DRM-free game with very low system requirements I bought from GOG long ago became the perfect candidate for the test. I then spun up a VM without an internet connection, moved the file over there, and installed it. Everything worked perfectly without the internet!

## Review

This combination of rouge-like dungeon crawler and disco kept me engaged for around 15 hours. It is the story of a woman (Cadence) descending into the crypt to search for her disappeared family members. A player is encouraged to move the character (using only four arrows) in tune with the beats and catchy music to avoid possible punishment.

You should expect to die a lot at first but all enemies' movements are predictable so, once practiced, you have better odds of beating a level. Not only that, you can collect diamonds in the dungeon to buy in-game upgrades (for better weapons, armor, shovels, spells, consumables, and accessories). This will help pave the way to success.

There are 11 characters (some are locked at the beginning) with distinct abilities to choose from, and most of them are fun to play in my opinion except monk, bolt, aria, and coda. A player can finish 4 levels (each has 3 sub-levels and a boss) using each character making it replayable. Additionally, there are all zones mode, story mode, etc., for a more hardcore player. There is a dance pad mode as well, which is easier than it would normally be in exchange for your sweat.

It is a very fun and engaging game, but I want to criticize the great difficulty spike after completing two-thirds of the main story. I believed I could do it maybe after 20 hours of practice but it seemed tedious and unrewarding to me so I decided to skip it entirely and watch cinematics on YouTube instead.
