# Crypt of the NecroDancer

It's the first PC game that I played after two years of inactivity. The thing is I was on QubesOS and I would like to try some games but my onboard Thinkpad X260 GPU I didn't have too many options. This game I bought from GOG long ago became the perfect candidate for the test. I then spin up a VM without internet connection, move the file over there, and installed it. Everything worked perfectly!

## Review

This combination of rouge-like dungeon crawler and disco kept me engaged for around 15 hours. It’s the story of a woman descending in the crypt to search for her family members. A player is encouraged to move the character in tune with the beats to avoid possible punishment. You should expect to die a lot at first but in-game upgrades and skills should finally pave the way to success.

It’s a very fun and engaging game, but I want to criticize the great difficulty spike after completing two thirds of the main story. I believed I could do it maybe after 20 hours of practice but it seemed tedious and unfun to me so I decided to skip it entirely and watch cinematics on Youtube instead. After all, there are 10 characters with distinct abilities to choose from, and most of them are fun to play in my opinion with the exception of monk, bolt, aria, and coda.

Ah, there is a dance pad mode as well for the obvious reason. The game becomes easier in this mode in exchange for your sweat.
