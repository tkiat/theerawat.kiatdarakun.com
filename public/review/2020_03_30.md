# Course: Introduction to Personal Branding (Coursera)

I was going to build my portfolio site and gaining more perspective about how to put myself out there sounds like a good idea. I, by chance, discovered this course and I got the certificate for free because of the coronavirus outbreak giveaway. This course is about how to construct personal branding without any practical assignment. The instructor talks in a casual and relaxing manner. The course is worth it to me though as I haven't been aware of some of the tips before, but the length is only around 4-10 hours and not at all in-depth.

## Summary

Branding serves both internal and external purposes. The internal purpose is finding what your values are and what you want to do, while the external purpose is making it easier for the right kinds of people to find you for the right kinds of work since you will become associated with certain qualities. You should remind yourself that personal branding is leadership, not a self-promotion campaign. You shouldn't make it too personal like expressing your political opinions.

The first step in building your brand is to know yourself. Despite the drawbacks, the instructor recommends the Myers-Briggs assessment. She thinks it's pretty accurate. You should be honest with your assessment.

To build your brand, choose three authentic cornerstone words that cover both professional and personal you to form a mission statement: what you have to offer the world. You should revisit those three words at least annually and don't have to share those words. The instructor recommends you have good photo quality and mentions queen Elizabeth I as a great example. Lighting, posture, how you dress are all important.

Your brand's board of directors is important. They are at least four people you reach out to when making major decisions who may not be made public. They should have 3 qualities:

1. You admire and respect
2. They care about you
3. Be honest with yourself.

Social media is important. Each platform is different for a different targeted group. The instructor recommends you have at most two platforms since you don't want your content to go stale. Everybody can opt for free platforms like Facebook but a self-employed person needs his/her own website.

You should create your brand's maintenance plan. You may update your brand regularly to convince others that you care about it preferably 2-5 times per week. You may use the 80/20 rule of content: 80 percent for the followers and 20 percent for self-promotion. Automation of feed updates is great but it can destroy a sense of personal connection. However, it allows you to set posting times suitable for your target group.

You should care about reputation management because people can use Google to find out about you, and reviews about your business. Yelp, for example, can affect restaurants' revenue. You should check your privacy settings on any platform and create alerts in search engines.

Regarding the digital privacy issues, you should assume everything you put out there is seen by enemies or anybody else. There is no such thing as free Wi-Fi. They track you. You should create strong passwords
