# Chasm

Hollow Knight got me hooked on metroidvania so I wanted to play another one. Later, there was a short period of GOG connect that allowed the owner of this game on steam to get one from GOG as well. I wanted this game cheap so I did a dirty trick, that is, I bought a cheap key on steam and later got this one on GOG for free. That's how it began.

## Review

Chasm is a story of a knight on the quest to save a mining town from vile beasts and help some missing persons there. Like many metroidvania games, the protagonist is stonger over time with better weapons, armors, strength, abilitis, and spells and the path to a more advanced level is gradually uncovered. I played at hard difficulty at first but, though I believed I could finish it, it was unfun to me. The normal difficulty is fine for my skill level and commitment.

You will discover the stories behind the mess in the mine via many journals, rescued persons, and professor Basden along the way. The art is retro-inspired and beautiful but, being procedurally generated, the path is algorithmic and not special. This makes the game lack personality. The enemies are quite bland but high in variety so they are not that boring. There is usually no conversation with bosses whatsoever and it is quite distasteful to find bosses trying to kill you for apparently no reason.

The flow of the story is quite strightforward, and therefore I don't find it as memorable as, say, Hollow Knight. Overall, I find this game fun enough to consider not a waste of my time at the first playthrough but I do not find it at all replayable.
