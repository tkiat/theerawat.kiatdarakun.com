# Anna's Quest

I got in on Humble Bundle first and then bought it again on GOG as a support.

## Review

This point-and-click adventure game features the story of a girl with telekinesis ability who has to take on the journey to heal her grandfather. During the journey, she will inspect and interact with a lot of objects and converse with key people to overcome a lot of obstacles in her quest. The story is similar kind to dark Grimms' Fairy Tales, but it is, in my opinion, as dark and well-written as some Disney animated movies so the game should be suitable for young children.

The gameplay looks simple from the outside and seems like a typical Barbie game for a 7-year-old maximum, but I personally find this game rather difficult. Without any guide, I can imagine spending so many hours with so many guesses and interactions. I want to particularly criticize one scene where you must senselessly pick the correct sequence to proceed. Other than that the solution to a puzzle is at least marginally sensible.

The 2.5D hand-drawn art is very colorful and full of personality. It invokes an inner child in me. Despite some flaws in logic, I recommend it to anybody, children and adults alike.
