# Brutal Legend

## Review

Brutal Legend is the story of a roadie who, after he died in a tragic incident in a world where true metal seems forgotten, finds himself in a heavy metal realm. This is the land filled with flames, rocks, skulls, black leather clothes with shiny accessories, hot metal chicks, etc. He takes on the journey to fight against the demons and protect humans over there. He keeps finding out more about the truth about the place and his origin as time goes by.

As for gameplay, you control him in the third person view and freely roam over the open world where main quests along with optional side quests await you. The game turns into more like a real-time strategy game in the latter half where you capture some towers and manage the resources (and also fight enemies yourself in between). You are equipped with an axe and a guitar that you can perform an amazing move with a combination of keystrokes (or gamepad buttons). A car (and later a wing) enables you to travel faster so there is no big pacing issue here.

The art is quite cartoony, which softens the (optional chosen) violence and gores. The soundtracks are taken from many popular metal bands such as Juda's Priest and Manowar. There is nothing that truly stands out in this game but, I would not be surprised if many gamers who also happen to be metal fans consider this game a masterpiece.
