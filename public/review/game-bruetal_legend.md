# Brutal Legend

## Review

Brutal Legend is the story of a roadie who, after he died in a tragic incident in a world where true metal seems forgotten, finds himself in a heavy metal realm. This is the land filled with flames, rocks, skulls, black leather clothes with shiny accessories, hot metal chicks, etc. Equipped with an axe and a guitar, he takes on the journey (sometimes in a car) to fight against the demons and protect humans over there. He keeps finding out more about the truth as time goes by.

As for gameplay, you control him in the third person view and freely roam over the open world where main quests along with optional side quests await you. The game turns into more like a strategy game in the latter half where you capture some towers and manage the resources. The soundtracks are taken from many popular metal bands such as Juda's Priest and Manowar. There is nothing that truly stands out in this game but, being largely heavy-metal focused, the game can be considered the masterpiece by a gamer who happens to be also a metal fan.
