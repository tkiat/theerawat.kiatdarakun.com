# Sundered: Eldritch Edition

I bought this game for $4.99 on GOG and found it surprisingly enjoyable. Even at the full price of $19.99, it is still worth it in my opinion.

## Review

Filled with Lovecraftian elements, this Metroidvania game is a story about a woman (named Eshe) who, under some sort of evil pull, falls into a ruined realm from the desert. She first meets with Shining Trapezohedron who becomes her weapon and, of course, travels with her in the realm. As they progress, she discovers more and more the story about the land. Her future, if she can escape to the upper land or not, depends on you!

The style of the hand-drawn art goes very well with the Lovecraftian theme. This, together with some creepy background music, inspires a sense of fear. I praise the big boss design a lot: the room is usually very big and this makes the fight epic. She can either destroy or embrace the shard gotten from mini-bosses and bosses. This choice affects her abilities, the final boss, and the ending cinematics. These alternatives make the game vastly replayable.

Eshe is weak at the beginning; however, she can collect yellow shards (or coins?) in between and spend that for a more upgraded skill tree that boosts her stats and other advantages in the sanctuary. A big horde of enemies comes at you at times, and this may often lead to your death. This is when you have a chance to upgrade your abilities after being respawned at the sanctuary.

I finished the game first on normal difficulty but in another playthrough, I chose another route from the beginning in easy difficulty. I was surprised that I still struggled at times even in the easy mode. I find this game very fun to play and recommend this to everyone who likes platformer and/or Metroidvania.
