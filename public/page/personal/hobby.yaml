      review: "It is a book about Leo Tolstoy who was not able to find the meaning of life despite his material success. The strongest message of his book I found is that the meaning of life cannot be found rationally. I rejected his religious solution. Instead, that message made me introspect my own emotional needs and personalities to find my purpose."

      review: "It is a graphic novel in a 1$ Humble Bundle package I bought long ago. It is a story of a black journalist who spied on lyncing of white supremacists against black people. He was about to retired, but fate made it more complicated. It is not light reading as it is full of racism and violence, but those seem necessary to reflect the past."

      review: "This graphic novel cost me 5$ on comiXology when it was still DRM-free. It is based on a famous written novel by Peter S. Beagle: a story of a unicorn trying to find the rest of her species. I didn't read it deeply and my key takeaway was only that you have to go out of your comfort zone if you want something."

      review: "I spent 25$ for the whole series from Humble Bundle. I would rate the comics as too violent for the kids with some (human) beheadings and sexual scenes. The story begins with the scene where people turning into zombies that eat people. The biggest takeaway for me is the reminder that many things nowadays that we think we cannot live without are actually superficial as they are completely useless in that situation."

      review: "This is a very simple two-dimensional game where only one character initially roams around the land, does some quests, makes new friends, and helps them fulfill their wishes. It is very short (less than an hour for my first playthrough) but there are alternative choices to be made, making it somewhat replayable. Overall, it is a nice point-and-click game in a style you can expect from Amanita Design (the maker of like Machinarium and Samorost). The jokes and animated interactions are carried out well in my opinion."

      review: "The game is basically the reverse of a tower defense game where you place towers to attack upcoming enemies. Instead, you control the convoys and navigate through the alien towers to do a lot of quests. The game is OK for story, good for mechanics, and quite polished for art. Every tower defense fan should try this sort of game at least once."

You need to interact with the world using a suitable creature's unique ability to pass through the scenes. The art is similar to that in children's books. In addition to that, the music, gestures, and communications are heartwarming, and I would recommend this game not only for kids but also for adults."

      review: "It is a story of a fallen girl in a monster realm who eventually seeks a way to come back on top. Despite Gameboyish graphics, the writing is praised by many and the story invokes a range of emotions. It seems everything you do matters. For example, the endings and dialog are different when you decide to kill or not kill a specific character (or all characters). The battle is entirely dodge-based which is new to me. In short, IGN gave it 10/10 so it is likely worth a shot."

      review: "You assume the role of a jetpack driver who is assigned missions to board a spaceship to complete some main and optional missions. The gameplay is very thrilling due to the limitation of time and resources along with several heterogeneous enemies. The game can be too difficult for super causal players though. It is very replayable due to two main modes and the many jetpack suits available. I enjoyed this game a lot and I would recommend it to anybody who likes a challenging real-time 2D shooting game."
