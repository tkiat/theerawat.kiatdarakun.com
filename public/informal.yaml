        link: "https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis1940/spring13/lectures.html"
        review_short: "I read Learn You a Haskell book before but I couldn't quite get much of it. I then stumbled across the best free introduction Haskell course according to somewhere on the internet so I took it. The instructor explains not very in details (based on reading only), which I found it sufficient. I gained much more understandings especially Monad. However, I didn't do any exercise since that seemed to take much time. You may request the solution from this GitHub link: https://github.com/byorgey/haskell-course."

        review_short: "I took this short course (probably < 3 hours with some preknowledge) for a free certificate. It is a guide to cloud computing with a brief explanation of related technologies. The instructor at times reads what is shown on slides and not explains everything that appears on them so I personally don't recommend this course. You are better off reading Wikipedia in my opinion."

        review_short: "A popular course about React.js for beginners. I paid and enrolled in this course as I wanted to build some websites (including my personal website). The basic contents are laid out nicely but the instructor didn't cover all advanced stuff. At the end he did a project that I followed along but I knew unless I did the project from scratch myself I wouldn't be familiar with the language."

        review_short: "I became aware that the web knowledge offers me significant freedom so I took some 5 web-related courses here. The courses are about basics HTML/CSS/JS, fornt-end/back-end coding, React.js, and a few other libraries. I deleted my account there so the certificate links are gone."

        link: "https://coursera.org/verify/specialization/LP2AXJ7TUNRV"
        review_short: "I was unexplainably drawn to computer science just a month after coming back from Germany, and algorithms seemed like the most important basics so I took it. I paid 49 USD for the certificate and finished within a month. This coursera specialization contains 4 algorithm-related courses focusing deeply on theory. I would recommend this course for an aspiring computer scientist, but I was not that drawn much to the theoretical side so I skipped some lectures. I am not impressed with the assignment format since anyone can just put a correct number to pass the assignment."
